/**
 * Actions to run after each stage of a [Pipeline] has been completed.
 * @param afterRegisteringLibraries action to run after the libraries have been registered and are ready to be looked up (libraries as arguments)
 * @param afterLexing action to run after the tokens have been produced (output tokens as arguments)
 * @param afterParsing action to run after the AST has been generated (root as an argument)
 * @param afterExpanding action to run after the queued function calls have been expanded (root as an argument)
 * @param afterTreeTraversal action to run after the produced AST has been visited
 * @param afterRendering action to run after the rendered output code has been generated (output code as an argument)
 * @param afterPostRendering action to run after the rendered output code has been manipulated (e.g. wrapped) (output code as an argument)
 * @param afterAllRendering action to run after all rendering has been completed.
 *                          It usually matches with [afterPostRendering].
 *                          If post-rendering is disabled, it will match with [afterRendering] instead.
