You can find the source files in the docs directory.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThis wiki complements the project documentation available at quarkdown.com/docs.\nWhile the documentation provides comprehensive details about functions, their inputs, and their outputs,\nthis wiki focuses on practical, user-centered guides that show how to use Quarkdown’s features in real-world scenarios.\n\nWhen a topic has particularly relevant documentation, you will find a  link that takes you directly to it.\n\nOther resources\n\n- README covers installation and getting started.\n- Visit the Discussions page to ask questions and share your creations.\n- The quarkdown-test module contains complete, working examples that you can use as reference.\n- Since Quarkdown extends CommonMark and GFM, this wiki does not cover standard Markdown syntax. For Markdown basics, see markdownguide.org.","headings":[{"anchor":"welcome-to-the-quarkdown-wiki","text":"Welcome to the Quarkdown Wiki","level":2},{"anchor":"documentation","text":"Documentation","level":3},{"anchor":"other-resources","text":"Other resources","level":3}]},{"url":"/Quickstart","title":"Quickstart","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Quickstart\n\nWelcome to Quarkdown! This guide walks you through the main features you need to create your first document.\n\n> If you use VS Code, we strongly recommend installing the official Quarkdown extension.\n\nThis guide provides a broad overview without diving deep into every detail. Each section includes links to other wiki pages where you can learn more about specific features.\n\nCreating a document\n\n> Reference: Project Creator\n\nTo create a new document, run the project creator from your terminal:\n\n\tquarkdown create my-document\n\nThis command creates a new folder named my-document. If you want to use the current working directory instead, you can omit the name.\n\nFor this quickstart, we recommend the following options:\n\n- Project name: Quickstart\n- Authors: <your name>\n- Document type: plain\n- Document language: English\n\nOnce the project is created, open my-document.qd in your favorite text editor. You can delete the existing content inside the first section if you want to start fresh.\n\n\t## Quickstart\n\t- Welcome to [Quarkdown](https://quarkdown.com)!\n\t- This is the starting point of your document.\n\t- ...\n\nChoosing a document type\n\n> Reference: Document types\n\nDuring the initial setup, you choose a document type from one of the following options:\n\n- plain: A continuous flow layout similar to Notion or Obsidian, ideal for knowledge management and web viewing.\n- paged: A traditional document layout with page breaks, perfect for PDFs.\n- slides: A presentation format with interactive navigation.\n\nChoosing a theme\n\n> Reference: Themes\n\nThemes are split into two groups: color themes define the color scheme of a document, while layout themes set the general structural rules of the layout.\n\n\t.theme {paperwhite} layout:{latex}\n\nSome popular combinations include:\n\n- paperwhite + latex: A clean academic look (this is the default)\n- darko + minimal: A dark theme with minimal styling\n- beaver + beamer: An academic presentation style\n\nSee Themes for a complete list of available themes.\n\nCompiling\n\n> Reference: Compiler\n\nCompile the document to make sure everything works as expected:\n\n\tcd my-document\n\tquarkdown c my-document.qd\n\nYou should see the HTML output inside the output directory.\n\nTo export to PDF, add the --pdf flag:\n\n\tquarkdown c my-document.qd --pdf\n\nSee the PDF export page for more information about PDF export and its requirements. If you installed Quarkdown using a package manager or the install script, you should be ready to go.\n\nLive preview\n\nTo launch live preview, append -p (preview) and -w (watch) to the compile command:\n\n\tquarkdown c my-document.qd -p -w\n\nThis opens the default browser automatically. To use a different browser, specify it with the --browser option, for example --browser chrome.\n\nIf you use VS Code with the Quarkdown extension, you can launch the live preview by clicking the magnifying glass button or pressing Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+V.\n\nMarkup\n\nQuarkdown builds upon Markdown and includes several GFM extensions. To try out basic markup, append the following to your document and experiment with it:\n\n\t### A Quarkdown tour\n\tNo need to reinvent the wheel: you can make text **bold** or *italic*,\n\t~~strike through~~, add `inline code`,\n\tcreate [links](https://quarkdown.com), and much more.\n\t- An unordered list\n\t- With multiple items\n\t1. An ordered list\n\t2. With multiple items\n\t![Logo](image/logo.png)\n\nFor a refresher on Markdown basics, see markdownguide.org.\n\nImage size\n\n> References: Image size, Size\n\nYou might have noticed that the image in the previous example appears too large. Quarkdown overcomes this well-known Markdown limitation by allowing you to specify image dimensions:\n\n\t!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png)\n\nNow the image is sized appropriately.\n\nThis sets the image width to 50% of the available width while maintaining the aspect ratio. Supported units include px, pt, cm, mm, in, and %. If you omit the unit, Quarkdown assumes px.\n\nTo specify both width and height:\n\n\t!(6cm 2cm)[Logo](image/logo.png)\n\nTo specify only the height:\n\n\t!(_ 2cm)[Logo](image/logo.png)\n\nFigures\n\n> Reference: Figures\n\nWhen an image stands alone, separated from other content, it automatically becomes a figure. Figures are centered and can have a caption.\n\nTake the previous image:\n\n\t!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png)\n\nYou can add a caption by appending a title in quotes:\n\n\t!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png \"The Quarkdown logo\")\n\nEquations and formulae\n\n> Reference: TeX formulae\n\nYou can include TeX equations using the $ expression $ syntax. Note that whitespace matters.\n\nAdd the following to the bottom of your document:\n\n\t#### Equations\n\t$ E = mc^2 $ is Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula.\n\t$ f(x, y) = \\frac{x}{y} $\n\nNotice that the second equation appears centered on its own line, even though it uses the same syntax. Just like figures, isolated equations automatically become block equations.\n\nFunction call syntax\n\n> Reference: Syntax of a function call\n\nBefore exploring more features, let’s look at Quarkdown’s function call syntax.\n\nFunction calls start with a dot and use curly braces for arguments. Arguments can be positional or named:\n\n\t.pow {5} to:{2} is a mathematical operation.\n\nFunction calls can be inline or block, depending on whether they appear within other content or stand alone.\n\nBlock function calls also support an indented block argument, which always corresponds to the last parameter of the function:\n\n\t.align {center}\n\t    This multi-line paragraph is the block argument,\n\t    and it's now centered in the document.\n\nYou can chain multiple function calls together, where the output of one becomes the first argument of the next:\n\nExample 1\n-----\n\t.sqrt {10}::round::multiply {2}\n\n6\n\n> you can find a full list of available functions in the documentation.\n\nVariables\n\n> Reference: Variables\n\nDefine a variable using the .var function and access it like any other function:\n\n\t.var {name} {John}\n\tMy name is .name\n\nTo change a variable’s value, call it with a new argument:\n\n\t.name {Jane}\n\nCustom elements\n\n> Reference: Declaring functions, Boxes\n\nYou can define custom functions using .function. Functions are reusable components that encapsulate logic and content. In this section, we create a function that generates an Example box, commonly used in educational documents.\n\nStart by defining a function without parameters:\n\n\t.docauthors\n\t    - ...\n\t.function {example}\n\t    .box {Example} type:{tip}\n\t        This is my example!\n\t## Quickstart\n\t...\n\nNow call it:\n\n\t## Quickstart\n\t.example\n\t...\n\nCalling .example produces a nicely formatted box.\n\nLet’s enhance the function by adding a parameter for the box content. The syntax for parameters is param1 param2 param3:.\n\n\t.function {example}\n\t    content:\n\t    .box {Example} type:{tip}\n\t        .content\n\nUpdate the call accordingly:\n\n\t.example\n\t    This is my example!\n\nCongratulations! You’ve created your first reusable element using boxes. Many more layout tools are available, such as containers and stacks.\n\nFor advanced styling of custom elements, you can use CSS rules. See CSS for more information.\n\n> For the sake of simplicity, let’s remove the function call for now:\n> \n> \t- .example\n> \t-    This is my example!\n\nNumbering\n\n> Reference: Numbering\n\nMany documents, especially academic ones, require numbered elements such as sections, figures, tables, equations, and code. In Quarkdown, you can achieve this using the .numbering function.\n\n> Documents with the paged type come with default numbering enabled.\n\nAdd a numbering scheme at the top of your document, right before the content begins:\n\n\t.docauthors\n\t    - ...\n\t.numbering\n\t    - headings: 1.1.1\n\t    - figures: 1.1\n\t.function {example}\n\t    ...\n\t## Quickstart\n\t...\n\n> This YAML-like syntax represents a dictionary data type.\n\nValid symbols for numbering formats are:\n\n- 1 for decimal numbers\n- A for uppercase letters\n- a for lowercase letters\n- I for uppercase Roman numerals\n- i for lowercase Roman numerals\n\nAny other character is treated as literal text.\n\nTable of contents\n\n> Reference: Table of contents\n\nLonger documents often include a table of contents at the beginning that lists all sections and subsections.\n\nIn Quarkdown, simply call the .tableofcontents function where you want the table of contents to appear:\n\n\t.numbering\n\t    - ...\n\t.tableofcontents\n\t## Quickstart\n\t...\n\nFootnotes\n\n> Reference: Footnotes\n\nFootnotes let you add additional information without cluttering the main text. Let’s add a footnote to our introduction:\n\n\t### A Quarkdown tour\n\tNo need to reinvent the wheel: you can make text **bold** or *italic*,\n\t~~strike through~~, add `inline code`,\n\tcreate [links](https://quarkdown.com), and much more[^1].\n\t[^1]: All Markdown features are supported in Quarkdown\n\nThis is the GFM footnote syntax, which Quarkdown fully supports. Quarkdown also supports compact footnotes, which let you define a footnote inline, right where you reference it:\n\n\tand much more[^: All Markdown features are supported in Quarkdown].\n\nIn plain documents, footnotes appear in the margin next to the reference, similar to side notes. In paged and slides documents, footnotes appear at the bottom of the page or slide.\n\nCross-references\n\n> Reference: Cross-references\n\nCross-references let you refer to numbered elements elsewhere in your document.\n\nFirst, add an ID to the target element. Then reference it using the .ref {id} function.\n\nTake our figure:\n\n\t!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png \"The Quarkdown logo\")\n\nAdd the logo ID to it and reference it in the text:\n\n\t!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png \"The Quarkdown logo\") {#logo}\n\tThe Quarkdown logo is shown in .ref {logo}.\n\nSee Cross-references to learn how to add IDs to other elements, such as sections, tables, equations, and code blocks.\n\nPage margins and counter\n\n> References: Page format, Page margin content, Page counter\n\nIn paged and slides documents, you typically want a page counter to help readers navigate and understand where they are in the document.\n\nFirst, switch to the paged document type by changing the .doctype value at the top of your document:\n\n\t- .doctype {plain}\n\t+ .doctype {paged}\n\n> The default page format is A4. You can change it, along with other properties, using the .pageformat function:\n> \n> \t.pageformat {letter} margin:{2cm}\n\nNow add a page counter to the bottom center of each page:\n\n\t.docauthors\n\t    - ...\n\t.pagemargin {bottomcenter}\n\t    .currentpage / .totalpages\n\t.numbering\n\t    - ...\n\nEach page now displays its number and the total number of pages.\n\nThe .pagemargin function can add any kind of content to each page. See Page margin content for all available margin positions.\n\nPersistent headings\n\n> Reference: Persistent headings\n\nPage margins can also display the current section title on each page. The following example shows the current level-1 heading in the bottom left margin:\n\n\t.pagemargin {bottomcenter}\n\t    ...\n\t.pagemargin {bottomleft}\n\t    .lastheading depth:{1}\n\t.numbering\n\t    - ...\n\nMulti-file projects\n\n> Reference: Inclusion vs. subdocuments\n\nThere are two main ways to split a large document into multiple source files: inclusion and subdocuments.\n\nIncluding files\n\n> Reference: Including other Quarkdown files\n\nThe .include function inserts the content of another Quarkdown file into the current one. This approach is common in LaTeX and other markup languages for splitting a large document into smaller, more manageable files, such as one per chapter or section.\n\nFor our quickstart, we could split setup and content into two separate files:\n\n> my-document.qd\n\n\t- .docname {Quickstart}\n\t- .doctype {paged}\n\t- .doclang {English}\n\t- .theme {paperwhite} layout:{latex}\n\t-\n\t- .docauthors\n\t-     - ...\n\t-\n\t- .pagemargin {bottomright}\n\t-     .currentpage / .totalpages\n\t-\n\t- .pagemargin {bottomleft}\n\t-     .lastheading depth:{1}\n\t-\n\t- .numbering\n\t-     - headings: 1.1.1\n\t-     - figures: 1.1\n\t+ .include {setup.qd}\n\t+ .include {content.qd}\n\t- .tableofcontents\n\t-\n\t- # Quickstart\n\t-\n\t- ...\n\n> setup.qd\n\n\t.docname {MyDocument}\n\t.doctype {paged}\n\t.doclang {English}\n\t.theme {paperwhite} layout:{latex}\n\t.docauthors\n\t    - Quarkdown\n\t.pagemargin {bottomright}\n\t    .currentpage / .totalpages\n\t.numbering\n\t    - headings: 1.1.1\n\t    - figures: 1.1\n\n> content.qd\n\n\t.tableofcontents\n\t## Quickstart\n\t...\n\nHere we used .include twice. For a larger number of files, consider using .includeall instead:\n\n\t.includeall\n\t    - setup.qd\n\t    - content.qd\n\nReferencing files\n\n> Reference: Subdocuments\n\nThe second approach uses subdocuments, which are particularly common for knowledge bases and wikis.\n\nSubdocuments are independent units of content that share the same setup and configuration. You can reference them from other documents through links.\n\n> my-document.qd\n\n\t- [Introduction](introduction.qd)\n\t- [Chapter 1](chapter1.qd)\n\t- [Chapter 2](chapter2.qd)\n\t- [Conclusion](conclusion.qd)\n\nYou can also visualize the knowledge graph formed by subdocuments:\n\n\t.subdocumentgraph\n\nConclusion\n\nCongratulations! You have completed the Quarkdown quickstart guide and are now familiar with its main features. You are ready to create your first real document.\n\nFrom here, you can explore more advanced topics in the rest of this wiki and in the documentation.","headings":[{"anchor":"creating-a-document","text":"Creating a document","level":2},{"anchor":"choosing-a-document-type","text":"Choosing a document type","level":3},{"anchor":"choosing-a-theme","text":"Choosing a theme","level":3},{"anchor":"compiling","text":"Compiling","level":2},{"anchor":"live-preview","text":"Live preview","level":2},{"anchor":"markup","text":"Markup","level":2},{"anchor":"image-size","text":"Image size","level":3},{"anchor":"figures","text":"Figures","level":3},{"anchor":"equations-and-formulae","text":"Equations and formulae","level":3},{"anchor":"function-call-syntax","text":"Function call syntax","level":2},{"anchor":"variables","text":"Variables","level":3},{"anchor":"custom-elements","text":"Custom elements","level":2},{"anchor":"numbering","text":"Numbering","level":2},{"anchor":"table-of-contents","text":"Table of contents","level":2},{"anchor":"footnotes","text":"Footnotes","level":2},{"anchor":"cross-references","text":"Cross-references","level":2},{"anchor":"page-margins-and-counter","text":"Page margins and counter","level":2},{"anchor":"persistent-headings","text":"Persistent headings","level":3},{"anchor":"multi-file-projects","text":"Multi-file projects","level":2},{"anchor":"including-files","text":"Including files","level":3},{"anchor":"referencing-files","text":"Referencing files","level":3},{"anchor":"conclusion","text":"Conclusion","level":2}]},{"url":"/Syntax-of-a-function-call","title":"Syntax of a function call","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Syntax of a function call\n\nFunctions are the key feature of Quarkdown, distinguishing it from other Markdown dialects and many other markup languages. They are loaded from external libraries, either native (e.g., standard library) or defined in a Quarkdown source, and come in different categories:\n\nLayout rulesUtility viewsMathematical and logical operationsControl structures and statementsFile dataAlteration of document metadataCategoryrow, column, grid, centertableofcontents, whitespacesum, divide, pow, sin, isgreaterif, foreach, repeat, var, let, functioninclude, csv, readdocname, docauthor, doctype, theme, pageformatExamples\n\nBasic syntax\n\nWhen called from a Quarkdown source, the function name is preceded by a . (dot) and each argument is wrapped in curly brackets.\n\n\t.myfunction {arg1} {arg2}\n\nExample 1\n-----\n\t.multiply {6} {3}\n\n18\n\nPositional and named arguments\n\nIn the previous snippet, arg1 and arg2 refer to the first and second parameter of the function signature respectively. These are called positional arguments because their meaning is determined by their position in the call.\n\nAn argument can also refer to a parameter by name. These named arguments use the syntax name:{arg}.\n\n\t.myfunction firstparam:{arg1} secondparam:{arg2}\n\nExample 2\n-----\nYou can mix positional and named arguments to improve readability of the function call, as long as all arguments that follow a named argument are named as well.\n\n\t.multiply {6} by:{3}\n\n18\n\nMulti-line arguments\n\nArguments can span over multiple lines. Indentation is optional and arbitrary.\n\nExample 3\n-----\n\t.divide {\n\t    .cos {.pi}\n\t} by:{\n\t    .sum {2} {1}\n\t}\n\n-0.33333334\n\nNested function calls\n\nFunction calls can be nested in arguments, allowing you to compose complex expressions.\n\nExample 4\n-----\n\t.multiply {.pow {3} to:{2}} by:{.pi}\n\n28.274334\n\nChaining calls\n\nAlthough Quarkdown exclusively relies on top-level declarations, it exploits some OOP-like syntactic sugar that greatly increases the readability of nested function calls.\n\nConsider the following call:\n\n\t.sum {.subtract {.pow {3} {2}} {1}} {2}\n\nThis performs (3^2 - 1) + 2 = 10. As simple as it is, it could not be harder to write and read! The following call is totally equivalent:\n\n\t.pow {3} {2}::subtract {1}::sum {2}\n\nMuch better. It now resembles the way we naturally read math.\n\nTo understand how chaining works, consider this simpler example (see Variables to learn more about variables):\n\n\t.myvar::uppercase\n\nBehind the scenes, the compiler transforms this call into:\n\n\t.uppercase {.myvar}\n\nExample 5\n-----\n\t.var {myvar} {hello!}\n\t.myvar::uppercase\n\nHELLO!\n\nGenerally speaking, .a::b is transformed into .b {.a}, .a::b::c into .c {.b {.a}}, and so on.\n\nYou can append additional arguments to any function in the chain. Just keep in mind that the chained value is always the first argument, positionally speaking, of the next call.\n\nExample 6\n-----\n.a {x}::b {y} is transformed into .b {.a {x}} {y}:\n\n\t.sum {10} {5}::multiply {2}\n\n30\n\nMany core functions are designed to be called in a chain, for example None operations.\n\nBlock vs. inline function calls\n\nFunction calls can appear in two contexts: inline or block.\n\nInline calls\n\nAn inline function call is preceded and/or followed by other inline content, such as text. The output of an inline function call is simply replaced in the parent’s block.\n\nExample 7\n-----\n\tEver wondered what **26+16** equals? It's .sum {26} {16}. Here you go.\n\nEver wondered what 26+16 equals? It’s 42. Here you go.\n\nBlock calls\n\nA block function call is an isolated one. For context, in Markdown, a block is a paragraph, a code snippet, a quote, a list, and so on.\n\n\tParagraph 1\n\t.myfunction {arg1} {arg2}\n\tParagraph 2\n\nThe body argument\n\nThe main difference between inline and block function calls is a special argument called body argument. This argument always refers to the last parameter of the signature (even if named arguments were used).\n\nA body argument expands over multiple lines, is not wrapped by brackets, and requires each line to be indented by at least two spaces or one tab:\n\n\t.myfunction {arg1} {arg2}\n\t    Body argument, line 1\n\t    and line 2.\n\nThe whole body must share the same indentation. The following produces unexpected results, as indentation is inconsistent:\n\n\t.myfunction {arg1} {arg2}\n\t    Body argument, line 1\n\t        and line 2. <!-- This is a 4-spaces indented code block! -->\n\nNesting functions in body arguments\n\nOther functions, block or inline, can be nested inside body arguments:\n\n\t.row alignment:{center}                    <!-- Block  -->\n\t    This document was made by .docauthor   <!-- Inline -->\n\t    .column                                <!-- Block  -->\n\t        The document name is .docname      <!-- Inline -->\n\t        .loremipsum                        <!-- Block  -->\n\nBody arguments and inline calls\n\nWhen nested inside inline arguments, function calls are always inline. Thus, the following is invalid since body arguments are accepted only in block calls:\n\n\t.center {\n\t    .row\n\t        Hi\n\t}\n\nWhile this is valid as .row is called within a body argument:\n\n\t.center\n\t    .row\n\t        Hi","headings":[{"anchor":"basic-syntax","text":"Basic syntax","level":2},{"anchor":"positional-and-named-arguments","text":"Positional and named arguments","level":2},{"anchor":"multi-line-arguments","text":"Multi-line arguments","level":2},{"anchor":"nested-function-calls","text":"Nested function calls","level":2},{"anchor":"chaining-calls","text":"Chaining calls","level":2},{"anchor":"block-vs-inline-function-calls","text":"Block vs. inline function calls","level":2},{"anchor":"inline-calls","text":"Inline calls","level":3},{"anchor":"block-calls","text":"Block calls","level":3},{"anchor":"the-body-argument","text":"The body argument","level":3},{"anchor":"nesting-functions-in-body-arguments","text":"Nesting functions in body arguments","level":3},{"anchor":"body-arguments-and-inline-calls","text":"Body arguments and inline calls","level":3}]},{"url":"/Declaring-functions","title":"Declaring functions","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Declaring functions\n\nYou can declare functions using the .function  function (in Quarkdown, everything is a function!).\n\nIt accepts two arguments: the function name and its body. The function can then be invoked as a normal function call – see Syntax of a function call.\n\nExample 1\n-----\n\t.function {helloworld}\n\t    Hello, world!\n\t.helloworld\n\nHello, world!\n\nParameters\n\nThe body parameter is a lambda, and each parameter of the function is a parameter of the lambda block. You can access each argument within the function body as a variable, which in Quarkdown is essentially a function with no parameters.\n\nExample 2\n-----\n\t.function {greet}\n\t    to from:\n\t    Hello, .to from .from!\n\t.greet {world} {John}\n\nHello, world from John!\n\n> You can name arguments to improve readability:\n> \n> \t.greet {world} from:{John}\n\nOptional parameters\n\nIf a function parameter ends with a question mark ?, it becomes optional. When you do not provide the corresponding argument, it receives the value None.\n\nExample 3\n-----\n\t.function {greet}\n\t    to from?:\n\t    Hello, .to from .from!\n\t.greet {world}\n\t.greet {world} {John}\n\nHello, world from None!\n\nHello, world from John!\n\nNone provides several useful operations, such as .otherwise for placeholders that emulate default parameter values.\n\nExample 4\n-----\n\t.function {greet}\n\t    to from?:\n\t    Hello, .to from .from::otherwise {unnamed}!\n\t.greet {world}\n\t.greet {world} {John}\n\nHello, world from unnamed!\n\nHello, world from John!\n\nBlock parameters\n\nBlock arguments always correspond to the last parameter of a function. There is no special syntax to declare them; just define the function as usual.\n\nExample 5\n-----\n\t.function {myexample}\n\t    title content:\n\t    .box {.title}\n\t        .content\n\t.myexample {Example title}\n\t    This is the content of the example.\n\nExample title\n-----\nThis is the content of the example.\n\nReturning values\n\nIn Quarkdown, there are no return statements. Every reached instruction becomes part of the output – see Conditional statements.\n\nExample 6\n-----\n\t.function {myfunction}\n\t    .if {.iseven {3}}\n\t        A\n\t    B\n\t.myfunction\n\nB\n\nFunctions can return any Markdown content.\n\nExample 7\n-----\n\t.function {greet}\n\t    to from:\n\t    **Hello, .to** from .from!\n\t.greet {world} from:{John}\n\nHello, world from John!\n\nQuarkdown is weakly typed, so functions can return any type of value.\n\nExample 8\n-----\n\t.function {area}\n\t    width height:\n\t    .multiply {.width} by:{.height}\n\tThe area of the rectangle is **.area {4} {2}**.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is 8.\n\nExample 9\n-----\n\t.function {isadult}\n\t    age:\n\t    .age::isgreater than:{18}\n\t.if {.isadult age:{20}}\n\t    You're an adult!\n\nYou’re an adult!","headings":[{"anchor":"parameters","text":"Parameters","level":2},{"anchor":"optional-parameters","text":"Optional parameters","level":3},{"anchor":"block-parameters","text":"Block parameters","level":3},{"anchor":"returning-values","text":"Returning values","level":2}]},{"url":"/Typing","title":"Typing","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Typing\n\nQuarkdown is dynamically typed: every value that may be passed to a function argument is wrapped in a DynamicValue object. This object can represent any supported type, and it carries the information needed to convert itself to the expected type when required.\n\nThe dynamic value is then adapted or converted to the type expected by the signature of the native function (written in Kotlin, which is strongly typed) at invocation time. If a conversion cannot be made, an error occurs.\n\nThis invoke-time adaptation reduces constraints, allowing the same value to be handled differently depending on its context.\n\nExample 1\n-----\n\t.var {myvar} {true}\n\t.if {.myvar}\n\t    My value is .uppercase {.myvar}\n\nMy value is TRUE\n\nIn the previous example:\n\n- .var’s signature accepts a DynamicValue.\n- .if takes a Boolean, so the dynamic true value kept in the myvar variable is converted to boolean.\n- .uppercase takes a String, so the true value is used as a string.\n\nSee the Value types section of this wiki to see all supported types.\n\nExample: source + result\n\nThe following example is a simplified version of a function defined in this wiki, which shows a Quarkdown code snippet and its visual result right below it:\n\nExample 2\n-----\n\t.function {sourceresult}\n\t    source:\n\t    .code {markdown}\n\t        .source\n\t    .source\n\t.sourceresult\n\t    ##!

Quarkdown \n\tQuarkdown was born in **.sum {2000} {24}**\n\nQuarkdown\n\nQuarkdown was born in 2024\n\nThe previous example shows how versatile Quarkdown values are. In the function declaration, the .source argument is retrieved twice:\n\n- In .code, which expects a string, so the source is read as-is and inserted in a code block.\n- At the top level: the Quarkdown source is automatically adapted to the context, so it is parsed as rich Markdown content.","headings":[{"anchor":"example-source--result","text":"Example: source + result","level":2}]},{"url":"/Localization","title":"Localization","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Localization\n\nQuarkdown supports string localization out of the box.\n\nThe first step is to set the document language via .doclang {locale}. Call this function among the other document metadata functions (such as .docname, .docauthor, etc.).\n\nThe locale value can be either a case-insensitive English full name (e.g., English, Italian, French (Canada)) or an IETF BCP 47 language tag (e.g., en, it, fr-CA).\n\nBuilt-in localization\n\nQuarkdown’s built-in libraries expose localization tables that localize elements such as quote types, numbering captions, and table of contents title.\n\n> The currently supported locales are English, Italian, German, French, Chinese, and Japanese.\n> \n> Contributions to support new locales are welcome:\n> \n> - stdlib\n> - paperlib\n\nCreating your own localized strings\n\nExample 1\n-----\nImagine a function .theorem that displays Theorem. before its content. You could define it as follows:\n\n\t.function {theorem}\n\t    **Theorem.**\n\t.theorem This is my theorem\n\nTheorem. This is my theorem\n\nThis works well for your own English document, but what if you are making a library for everyone to use? You would need to support multiple languages. This is where localization tables come in.\n\nThe .localization {name} function defines a new localization table associated with a unique name. Its body parameter accepts a particular Markdown list that, in Quarkdown, is called a dictionary.\n\nThis localization dictionary exposes key-value pairs for each locale that you intend to support. The locale names follow the same rules as those from .doclang, meaning they can be full names or tags. As long as .doclang is set, you can access the localized string via .localize {table:key}, in this case .localize {mylib:theorem}.\n\nExample 2\n-----\nThe previous function would now look like this:\n\n\t.localization name:{mylib}\n\t    - English\n\t      - theorem: Theorem\n\t    - Italian\n\t      - theorem: Teorema\n\t.function {theorem}\n\t    **.localize {mylib:theorem}.**\n\t.theorem This is my theorem\n\nTheorem.

Any conflicting entries will be replaced by the new ones.\n\nFor instance, typed boxes feature a localized title by default, such as Warning for a warning-typed box. If the document locale is not supported, the title will be missing. To extend the built-in localization with box titles in Canadian French, use the following approach:\n\n\t.localization {std} merge:{yes}\n\t    - fr-CA\n\t      - warning: Avertissement\n\t      - error: Erreur\n\t      ...\n\nAfter that, assuming Canadian French is set in .doclang, the new entries will be available to the .box function.\n\nBuilt-in table names and entries are listed in this page’s Built-in localization.","headings":[{"anchor":"built-in-localization","text":"Built-in localization","level":2},{"anchor":"creating-your-own-localized-strings","text":"Creating your own localized strings","level":2},{"anchor":"extending-a-built-in-localization-table","text":"Extending a built-in localization table","level":2}]},{"url":"/Document-metadata","title":"Document metadata","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Document metadata\n\nYou can set document information using the following functions.

A key string. The element’s number is counted across previous occurrences with the same key.\n2. A lambda block that takes the number as an argument, formatted according to the active numbering format.\n\n\t.numbered {greetings}\n\t    number:\n\t    **Hello!** This block has the number **.number**\n\nExecuting the previous block renders an empty string in place of number because you need to specify the numbering format for greetings in the .numbering call:\n\n\t.numbering\n\t    ...\n\t    - greetings: 1.a\n\nA numbered block can also be cross-referenced. See Cross-references for details.\n\nFull example:\n\nExample 9\n-----\n\t.numbering\n\t    - headings: 1.1\n\t    - greetings: 1.a\n\t## Title 1\n\t.numbered {greetings}\n\t    number:\n\t    **Hello!** This block has the number **.number**\n\t.numbered {greetings}\n\t    number:\n\t    **Hey!** This has instead the number **.number**\n\t## Title 2\n\t.numbered {greetings}\n\t    number:\n\t    **Hi!** Here we have the number **.number**\n\n\n\nLocalization\n\nThe localized name of the labeled element appears in captions if .doclang is set and the locale is supported. For instance, Figure and Table for the English locale, Figura and Tabella for Italian.","headings":[{"anchor":"default-formats","text":"Default formats","level":2},{"anchor":"merging-configurations","text":"Merging configurations","level":2},{"anchor":"headings","text":"Headings","level":2},{"anchor":"decorative-headings","text":"Decorative headings","level":3},{"anchor":"figures","text":"Figures","level":2},{"anchor":"tables","text":"Tables","level":2},{"anchor":"equations","text":"Equations","level":2},{"anchor":"code-blocks","text":"Code blocks","level":2},{"anchor":"footnotes","text":"Footnotes","level":2},{"anchor":"custom-numbered-elements","text":"Custom numbered elements","level":2},{"anchor":"localization","text":"Localization","level":2}]},{"url":"/Paragraph-style","title":"Paragraph style","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Paragraph style\n\nThe .paragraphstyle  function allows you to override the global style of paragraphs.\n\nAll parameters are optional, and if left unset, they delegate their value to the active theme.\n\nlineheightletterspacingspacingindentParameterWhitespace between lines, multiplied by the font size.Whitespace between letters, multiplied by the font size.Whitespace between subsequent paragraphs, multiplied by the font size.Whitespace at the start of each non-first paragraph, multiplied by the font size.DescriptionNumberNumberNumberNumberAccepts\n\nUsing spacing:{0} indent:{2} produces the classic LaTeX look.\n\nExample 1\n-----\n\t.paragraphstyle lineheight:{2.5} spacing:{0} indent:{2}","headings":[]},{"url":"/Caption-position","title":"Caption position","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Caption position\n\nThe .captionposition  function sets the global position of captions relative to the elements they describe.\n\nThis applies to:\n\n- Figures\n\t- Figure Markdown extension\n\t- .figure\n\t- Mermaid diagrams and derivatives such as XY charts\n- Tables\n\t- Table caption Markdown extension\n\t- Tables from CSV\n- Code blocks\n\t- Code caption Markdown extension\n\t- .code\n\n-----\n\nThe primary parameter, called default, sets the global style for all captioned elements.

Readers can click on any entry to jump directly to that section. You can see a table of contents right now in the right sidebar, or at the end of the page if you’re on a mobile device.\n\nYou can display a table of contents through the .tableofcontents  function.\n\nBasic usage\n\nThe function accepts the following optional parameters:\n\ntitlemaxdepthfocusParameterTitle that precedes the table of contents.

Decorative headings serve this purpose: they are not numbered and do not appear in the table of contents by default.\n\nTo mark a heading as decorative, append ! to the last # sign:\n\n\t##! A decorative heading\n\nIf you want decorative headings to appear in the table of contents anyway, enable the includeunnumbered parameter:\n\n\t.tableofcontents includeunnumbered:{yes}\n\nCustom numbering\n\nYou can customize how headings are numbered in the table of contents via the .numbering function.

The .marker function creates an invisible level-0 heading, which is not normally possible with the standard #-based syntax.\n\nHere is a practical pattern for chapter slides:\n\n\t.function {chapter}\n\t    name:\n\t    .tableofcontents maxdepth:{0} focus:{.name}\n\t    .marker {.name}\n\nYou can then invoke it with .chapter {My chapter} at the start of each section.

The .includeall function, which takes an Iterable of paths, serves as a convenient shorthand for repeated .include calls.\n\nThe following snippet is from Mock’s main.qd file:\n\n\t.includeall\n\t    - setup.qd\n\t    - headings.qd\n\t    - paragraphs.qd\n\t    - lists.qd\n\t    - images.qd\n\t    - tables.qd\n\t    - code.qd\n\t    - textformatting.qd\n\t    - colorpreview.qd\n\t    - quotes.qd\n\t    - boxes.qd\n\t    - math.qd\n\t    - footnotes.qd\n\t    - mermaid.qd\n\t    - collapsibles.qd\n\t    - errors.qd\n\t    - icons.qd\n\t    - separators.qd\n\t    - alignment.qd\n\t    - stacks.qd\n\t    - crossreferences.qd\n\t    - bibliography.qd\n\t    - localization.qd\n\nYou can also combine the function with .listfiles to automatically include all files in a directory:\n\n\t.includeall {.listfiles {somedirectory} sortby:{name}}\n\nContext sharing\n\nThe .include function’s sandbox parameter lets you control how much isolation the included file has from the main file. The included file always inherits the context of the main file, but you can optionally allow changes in the included file to propagate back.\n\nFor these examples, consider the following files:\n\n> file.qd\n> \n> \t.docname {New name}\n> \t.function {greet}\n> \t  name:\n> \t  Hello, **.name**!\n\n> main.qd\n> \n> \t.docname {My document}\n> \t.include {file.qd} sandbox:{<value>}\n> \t1. .docname\n> \t2. .greet {John}\n\nHere are the available options, in ascending order of isolation:\n\nshare (default)\n\nBoth contexts are synchronized bidirectionally. Any customization, function, variable, and other information declared in the included file will also be available in the main file, and vice versa.\n\n> Output:\n> \n> 1. New name\n> 2. Hello, John!\n\nscope\n\nSimilar to share, but function and variable declarations do not propagate back to the main file.\n\nThis is the same behavior used in nested lambda scopes, such as in .function and .foreach.\n\n> Output:\n> \n> 1. New name\n> 2. Compile error: .greet is not defined.\n\nsubdocument\n\nThe included file is completely isolated from the main file.

In practice, when I do this, I am referring to a subdocument.\n\nEvery project consists of at least one subdocument: the main one, called root.\n\n> Do not confuse subdocuments with inclusion. See Inclusion vs. subdocuments for a comparison.\n\nReferencing subdocuments\n\nWhenever a Markdown link points to a local .qd or .md file, it is considered a reference to a subdocument.\n\n\t[My subdocument](file.qd)\n\nEquivalently, you can use the .subdocument {path} {label?}  function:\n\n\t.subdocument {file.qd} label:{My subdocument}\n\nUnlike the link syntax, the function accepts dynamic paths, making it suitable for more complex use cases. For instance, you can use it in combination with .listfiles to automatically link all documents in a directory through a for-each loop:\n\n\t.foreach {.listfiles {pages} sortby:{date} order:{descending}}\n\t    path:\n\t    .subdocument {.path} label:{.path::filename}\n\nQuarkdown makes sure a file is evaluated only once, so circular and recursive references are handled gracefully.\n\nContext inheritance\n\nWhen referencing a subdocument, its content is evaluated like an independent Quarkdown document.\n\nA relevant difference is that subdocuments inherit the referrer’s context: document metadata, customizations, functions, variables, and more.\n\nExample 1\n-----\n> main.qd:\n> \n> \t.doctype {paged}\n> \t.theme {darko}\n> \t.pageformat margin:{1cm}\n> \t.function {greet}\n> \t    Hello!\n> \t[Introduction](introduction.qd)\n\n> introduction.qd:\n> \n> \tNo need to set the document up again, it's already inherited!\n> \t.greet\n\nUnlike .include, the context is inherited, not shared: changes made in the subdocument do not affect the referrer.\n\nExample 2\n-----\nThe following example produces an error because greet is not defined in the referrer context:\n\n> main.qd:\n> \n> \t[Introduction](introduction.qd)\n> \t.greet <!-- Error: unresolved -->\n\n> introduction.qd:\n> \n> \t.function {greet}\n> \t    Hello!\n\nWorking directory\n\nThe working directory of a subdocument is relative to the subdocument’s entry point, not the referrer:\n\n\tmain.qd\n\tpages/\n\t| introduction.qd\n\timages/\n\t| image.png\n\nWhereas main.qd can reference images/image.png, introduction.qd should reference it as ../images/image.png.\n\n> The media storage system can still store media files across subdocuments.\n\nSubdocument graph\n\nSubdocuments are structured in a directed graph, where the edges are the links between them.\n\nYou can visualize the graph via the .subdocumentgraph function:\n\nOutput\n\nSubdocuments are exported differently depending on the output target.\n\nHTML\n\nEach subdocument is exported as a separate subdirectory in the same directory as index.html.\n\nConfiguration resources, such as themes and runtime scripts, are generated only once. Media is stored per subdocument instead.\n\n\tMyDocument/\n\t|  media/\n\t|  theme/\n\t|  script/\n\t|  introduction/\n\t|  |  media/\n\t|  |  index.html\n\t|  conclusion/\n\t|  |  media/\n\t|  |  index.html\n\t|  index.html\n\nPDF\n\nEach subdocument is exported as a separate PDF file.\n\n\tMyDocument/\n\t| index.pdf\n\t| introduction.pdf\n\t| conclusion.pdf\n\n> Subdocument links in PDF output are not navigable yet.\n\nIf only the root subdocument is present, then only MyDocument.pdf is generated without the need for a directory.\n\nMinimizing name collisions\n\nSince the subdocument output files lie flatly in the same directory, it is possible that two subdocuments with the same name but from different directories end up colliding.\n\nBy default, Quarkdown accepts this collision-prone behavior in order to generate human-readable URLs.\n\nIf collisions cannot be avoided, launching the compiler with the --no-subdoc-collisions flag will append a hash to the output file names.","headings":[{"anchor":"referencing-subdocuments","text":"Referencing subdocuments","level":2},{"anchor":"context-inheritance","text":"Context inheritance","level":2},{"anchor":"working-directory","text":"Working directory","level":2},{"anchor":"subdocument-graph","text":"Subdocument graph","level":2},{"anchor":"output","text":"Output","level":2},{"anchor":"html","text":"HTML","level":3},{"anchor":"pdf","text":"PDF","level":3},{"anchor":"minimizing-name-collisions","text":"Minimizing name collisions","level":3}]},{"url":"/Inclusion-vs-subdocuments","title":"Inclusion vs subdocuments","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Inclusion vs subdocuments\n\nQuarkdown offers two ways to include content from other files: inclusion and subdocumenting.

This is an opaque operation because the output contains no traces of the original file.\n\nExample 1\n-----\n> main.qd:\n> \n> \tHello 1\n> \t.include {other.qd}\n\n> other.qd:\n> \n> \tHello 2\n\n\t<p>Hello 1</p>\n\t<p>Hello 2</p>\n\nContext\n\nThe execution context is shared between the main file and the included file.\n\nAny customization, function, variable, and other information declared in the main file will be available in the included file, and vice versa.\n\nYou can optionally restrict this behavior via the sandbox parameter.\n\nCircular references\n\nCircular or recursive inclusions are not allowed and will result in an error.\n\nSubdocuments\n\nSubdocuments are independent and referenceable source files.\n\nSubdocuments render as separate resources, and Quarkdown stores links to them in a graph structure.\n\nExample 2\n-----\n> main.qd:\n> \n> \tHello 1\n> \t[Other](other.qd)\n\n> other.qd:\n> \n> \tHello 2\n\n\t<p>Hello 1</p>\n\t<p><a href=\"./other\">Other</a></p>\n\n\t<p>Hello 2</p>\n\nContext\n\nWhen evaluating subdocuments, the context is inherited from the referrer.\n\nAny customization and declaration made in the referrer will be available in the subdocument, but not the other way around.\n\nCircular references\n\nEach subdocument is evaluated only once, so circular and recursive references are allowed.","headings":[{"anchor":"inclusion","text":"Inclusion","level":2},{"anchor":"context","text":"Context","level":3},{"anchor":"circular-references","text":"Circular references","level":3},{"anchor":"subdocuments","text":"Subdocuments","level":2},{"anchor":"context","text":"Context","level":3},{"anchor":"circular-references","text":"Circular references","level":3}]},{"url":"/Importing-external-libraries","title":"Importing external libraries","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Importing external libraries\n\nThe .include function, previously seen in Including other Quarkdown files, can also import external libraries.\n\nWhen you download Quarkdown or build it via distZip, the lib/qd directory contains utility libraries written in Quarkdown itself.\n\n\tquarkdown/\n\t├─ lib/qd/\n\t│  ├─ lib.qd\n\t│  ├─ ...\n\t├─ bin/\n\t│  ├─ quarkdown.jar\n\nYou can import .qd files into a Quarkdown project via .include {name}, without the file extension.\n\nFor example, to import paper.qd, use .include {paper}.\n\n> Unlike .include {path}, this approach only loads declared symbols without appending Markdown content from the file.\n\n> The default library directory is <install directory>/lib/qd.

The .code function, on the other hand, accepts any Quarkdown string as its body parameter, which means you can evaluate functions before displaying their output as code. This is particularly useful when combining .code with .read to load a code snippet from a file:\n\nExample 3\n-----\n\t.code\n\t    .read {assets/Point.ts}\n\n\texport class Point {\n\t    x: number;\n\t    y: number;\n\t    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n\t        this.x = x;\n\t        this.y = y;\n\t    }\n\t}\n\nLanguage specification\n\nStandard fenced code blocks specify their language right after the opening delimiter, for example ```markdown.\n\nThe .code function specifies the language through the optional lang argument, for example .code {markdown} or .code lang:{markdown}. If unspecified, auto-detection is attempted.\n\nExample 4\n-----\n\t.code lang:{typescript}\n\t    .read {assets/Point.ts}\n\n\texport class Point {\n\t    x: number;\n\t    y: number;\n\t    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n\t        this.x = x;\n\t        this.y = y;\n\t    }\n\t}\n\nLine numbers\n\nStandard code blocks always show line numbers by default. The .code function lets you toggle line numbers using the optional linenumbers Boolean argument, which defaults to yes (equivalent to true).\n\nExample 5\n-----\n\t.code linenumbers:{no}\n\t    .read {assets/Point.ts}\n\n\texport class Point {\n\t    x: number;\n\t    y: number;\n\t    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n\t        this.x = x;\n\t        this.y = y;\n\t    }\n\t}\n\nFocused lines\n\nThe .code function allows you to focus on a Range of lines, starting from 1. Line numbers must be enabled for this feature to work.\n\nExample 6\n-----\n\t.code focus:{5..8}\n\t    .read {assets/Point.ts}\n\n\texport class Point {\n\t    x: number;\n\t    y: number;\n\t    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n\t        this.x = x;\n\t        this.y = y;\n\t    }\n\t}\n\nInline code\n\nJust as .code is a dynamic alternative to triple backticks (```), .codespan {text} is a dynamic alternative to inline backticks (`text`).

The thesis is updated to September 2024, while this section is going to be kept up to date.","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Lexing","title":"Pipeline - Lexing","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Lexing\n\n> Main packages: core.lexer\n\nLexing is like breaking down a sentence into its individual words before figuring out the meaning of the sentence. Imagine you are reading a paragraph, and before understanding the message, you first recognize individual words like nouns, verbs, and punctuation.\n\nIn Quarkdown, the lexing process scans a source file, which is nothing but a sequence of characters, and splits it into small pieces called tokens. Each token represents a different element, like a heading, a paragraph, or bold text, and stores basic information such as its type, its position in the text, and its textual content (lexeme).\n\nMarkdown recognizes two macro-categories of tokens: block tokens and inline tokens. The difference is based on how these elements are structured in the document:\n\n- Blocks are sections that define the outer structure of a document. For example, a paragraph, a list, a heading, a code block, or a quote.\n\t\t# A heading\n\t\tA paragraph\n\t\t> A quote\n\t\t- A list\n\t\t- of multiple items\n\n- \n\n- Inlines are elements that appear inside blocks and define, most commonly, textual features such as formatting. For example, bold, italics, monospaced, links, and images.\n\t\tA **formatted** _text_.\n\nTo accomplish this separation, two distinct lexers are supplied: a block lexer and an inline lexer, which extract their corresponding tokens.\n\nFunction calls are extracted both as blocks and inlines, with just a few differences between them.\n\nAt the beginning, only the block lexer is invoked. Once the source is broken down into its outer blocks, they are passed to the parser, which is delegated to search for nested information.","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Parsing","title":"Pipeline - Parsing","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Parsing\n\n> Main packages: core.parser, core.ast\n\nContinuing with the metaphor introduced in Lexing, once the nouns, verbs, and adjectives are extracted from a sentence, our brain is responsible for linking them together to build information out of them.\n\nThe parser takes the sequence of tokens and organizes them into a tree structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which defines the relationships between different parts of the document. Each element of the tree is called a Node.\n\n-----\n\nExample Markdown input:\n\n\t## Title\n\tThis is **bold** and _italic_ text.\n\t- Item 1\n\t- Item 2\n\nOutput AST:\n\n- AstRoot\n\t- Heading(depth=1)\n\t\t- Text(\"Title\")\n\t- Paragraph\n\t\t- Text(\"This is \")\n\t\t- Strong(\"bold\")\n\t\t- Text(\" and \")\n\t\t- Emphasis(\"italic\")\n\t\t- Text(\" text\")\n\t- UnorderedList\n\t\t- ListItem\n\t\t\t- Paragraph\n\t\t\t\t- Text(\"Item 1\")\n\t\t- ListItem\n\t\t\t- Paragraph\n\t\t\t\t- Text(\"Item 2\")\n\n-----\n\nThe lexing stage produces just the outer blocks, which in this example are a HeadingToken, a ParagraphToken, and an UnorderedListToken.\n\nTo gain nested information, the parser analyzes each token and starts searching in depth for nested blocks and inlines.\n\n- For each block token, the parser triggers the lexing stage on its inner content (lexeme)\n- Once the inner tokens are extracted, they undergo the parsing stage again\n- This process continues until no more nested tokens remain. This is called recursive parsing, visualized in the following figure:","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Function-call-expansion","title":"Pipeline - Function call expansion","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Function call expansion\n\n> Main packages: core.function\n\nAmong the nodes generated from the Parsing stage, those of type FunctionCallNode(context, name, arguments) represent function calls.\n\nWhile all other nodes never change after they are created, this is the only kind of mutable node, which means its inner data is expected to change after the AST has been fully generated. Its mutation affects its child nodes, which is initially an empty collection that is later populated by a component called function call expander.\n\nBefore addressing the expansion itself, we should understand how data is exchanged among functions. Quarkdown functions, either explicitly or implicitly, always return a Value, a type-checked object wrapper.\n\nIn Quarkdown, not all types can be returned and not all types can be used as arguments. Therefore, functions should feature InputValue parameters and return an OutputValue. A complete set of value types is visualized in the following Venn-UML diagram:\n\nWhenever a function returns some OutputValue, it must be converted to some Node that can be rendered on screen. For instance, a StringValue becomes text, an OrderedCollectionValue becomes an ordered list, a BooleanValue becomes a checkbox, a DictionaryValue becomes a table, and so on. This operation is handled by a value-node mapper.\n\nFor each function call node enqueued by the parser, the corresponding function is looked up among loaded libraries, argument-parameter bindings are established, and the function is executed to obtain its output.\nAfter retrieving the output node from the mapper, the expander can push it to the function call’s child nodes, ready for the next stage.","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Tree-traversal","title":"Pipeline - Tree traversal","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Tree traversal\n\n> Main packages: core.ast.iterator, core.context.hooks\n\nAfter the function calls have been expanded, the AST is traversed depth-first to gather enriched information about the document, such as:\n\n- Heading hierarchy, used for the table of contents\n- Numbering: each heading, figure, and other numbered element is assigned a unique number based on its location in the heading hierarchy\n- Link definition bound to each link reference\n\nFor performance reasons, only one traversal is performed during this stage. Each operation can however act independently by attaching its own hook to the tree iterator, which is triggered when nodes of a certain kind are encountered.","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Rendering","title":"Pipeline - Rendering","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Rendering\n\n> Main packages: core.rendering\n> \n> Rendering modules: quarkdown-html, quarkdown-plaintext\n\nOnce the AST is fully generated and enriched, it is time to translate it into a target format, such as HTML.\n\nThis translation is performed via a depth-first traversal of the AST, starting from the root. Each visit to a node produces some output (in the case of HTML, an element tag) which, ideally in a one-to-one fashion, translates the information stored by the node into the target format.\n\nTo ensure scalability, Quarkdown locates each rendering target in external modules, such as quarkdown-html, which can be plugged into the core architecture.\n\n-----\n\nExample Markdown input:\n\n\t## Title\n\tThis is **bold** and _italic_ text.\n\t- Item 1\n\t- Item 2\n\nOutput HTML:\n\n\t<h1>Title</h1>\n\t<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text.</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t  <li>Item 1</li>\n\t  <li>Item 2</li>\n\t</ul>","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Post-rendering","title":"Pipeline - Post rendering","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Post rendering\n\n> Main packages: core.rendering, core.template, core.pipeline.output\n> \n> Rendering modules: quarkdown-html\n\nAfter obtaining the translation of the AST to the target format from the Renderer, you might notice that it is not enough to display to the user. Considering the HTML format, that is just the content that would go inside <body>, but everything else is missing: metadata, styling, and possibly a runtime.\n\nHere comes the post-renderer, which takes a template (HTML sample, made for an ad-hoc engine, and injects all the needed data into it, such as:\n\n- The content itself, placed into <body>\n- The document target (plain/slides/paged). Each target requires different scripts and stylesheets\n- User-defined properties, such as title and page format\n- The need to load certain libraries, such as MathJax for rendering LaTeX formulas. This is only done if at least one formula is used\n\nOn top of that, the post-renderer is also responsible for returning the output resources of the compilation. These resources include:\n\n- The generated HTML\n- The group of stylesheets (global stylesheet, layout theme, and color theme)\n- The group of required runtime scripts\n\nThese resources are then added to those provided by the media storage and ultimately returned by the pipeline.\nIt is then up to the invoker to handle those resources, which in the case of CLI are saved to file.","headings":[]},{"url":"/Inside-live-preview","title":"Inside live preview","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Inside live preview\n\nQuarkdown’s webserver enables direct communication between the compiler’s CLI and the browser, which makes live previewing possible.\n\nThe server exposes the following endpoints:\n\n- /:file: Serves static files relative to the target file (the -f option of quarkdown start).\n\n- \n\n- /live/:file: Works similarly to the previous endpoint, but wraps HTML files in a wrapper that enables live reloading.\n\n- \n\n- /reload: A WebSocket endpoint for live reloading.\n\t- Browsers connected to the /live endpoint listen for reload messages and refresh the page when they receive one.\n\t- The CLI connects to this endpoint and sends a message every time a compilation completes. When this happens, the server broadcasts a reload message to all connected browsers.\n\nLive preview wrapper\n\nWhen serving a file through the /live/:file endpoint, the server wraps HTML files in a simple HTML wrapper that displays the content of /:file in an iframe.\n\nAdditionally, a small script establishes a persistent WebSocket connection to the /reload endpoint. This script listens for reload messages and triggers a reload of the iframe content when it receives one.\n\nDouble buffering\n\nWhen an iframe reloads, an unpleasant flickering effect can occur. To provide a smooth user experience, Quarkdown employs a technique called double buffering.\n\nFor context, you encounter double buffering constantly in everyday computing: your GPU renders the next frame to an off-screen buffer while displaying the current frame. Once the next frame is ready, the buffers swap, resulting in a smooth transition without flickering.\n\nQuarkdown applies the same principle by maintaining two iframes, A and B. Suppose A is currently visible. When a change is detected, Quarkdown renders the updated content into B while A remains on screen. Once the rendering completes, the visible iframe switches from A to B, providing a seamless update.\n\nBefore swapping the buffers, the system also preserves the scroll position from the previous frame and restores it in the new frame, so you do not lose your place in the document.","headings":[{"anchor":"live-preview-wrapper","text":"Live preview wrapper","level":2},{"anchor":"double-buffering","text":"Double buffering","level":3}]},{"url":"/CLI-Project-creator","title":"CLI - Project creator","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"CLI - Project creator\n\nThe project creator is a CLI project wizard that makes it fast to set up a new Quarkdown project.\n\nquarkdown create [directory] launches the wizard and generates the project files in the given directory (it will\nbe created if it does not exist).

They are loaded from external libraries, either native (e.g., standard library) or defined in a Quarkdown source, and come in different categories:\n\nLayout rulesUtility viewsMathematical and logical operationsControl structures and statementsFile dataAlteration of document metadataCategoryrow, column, grid, centertableofcontents, whitespacesum, divide, pow, sin, isgreaterif, foreach, repeat, var, let, functioninclude, csv, readdocname, docauthor, doctype, theme, pageformatExamples\n\nBasic syntax\n\nWhen called from a Quarkdown source, the function name is preceded by a . (dot) and each argument is wrapped in curly brackets.\n\n\t.myfunction {arg1} {arg2}\n\nExample 1\n-----\n\t.multiply {6} {3}\n\n18\n\nPositional and named arguments\n\nIn the previous snippet, arg1 and arg2 refer to the first and second parameter of the function signature respectively. These are called positional arguments because their meaning is determined by their position in the call.\n\nAn argument can also refer to a parameter by name. These named arguments use the syntax name:{arg}.\n\n\t.myfunction firstparam:{arg1} secondparam:{arg2}\n\nExample 2\n-----\nYou can mix positional and named arguments to improve readability of the function call, as long as all arguments that follow a named argument are named as well.\n\n\t.multiply {6} by:{3}\n\n18\n\nMulti-line arguments\n\nArguments can span over multiple lines. Indentation is optional and arbitrary.\n\nExample 3\n-----\n\t.divide {\n\t    .cos {.pi}\n\t} by:{\n\t    .sum {2} {1}\n\t}\n\n-0.33333334\n\nNested function calls\n\nFunction calls can be nested in arguments, allowing you to compose complex expressions.\n\nExample 4\n-----\n\t.multiply {.pow {3} to:{2}} by:{.pi}\n\n28.274334\n\nChaining calls\n\nAlthough Quarkdown exclusively relies on top-level declarations, it exploits some OOP-like syntactic sugar that greatly increases the readability of nested function calls.\n\nConsider the following call:\n\n\t.sum {.subtract {.pow {3} {2}} {1}} {2}\n\nThis performs (3^2 - 1) + 2 = 10. As simple as it is, it could not be harder to write and read! The following call is totally equivalent:\n\n\t.pow {3} {2}::subtract {1}::sum {2}\n\nMuch better. It now resembles the way we naturally read math.\n\nTo understand how chaining works, consider this simpler example (see Variables to learn more about variables):\n\n\t.myvar::uppercase\n\nBehind the scenes, the compiler transforms this call into:\n\n\t.uppercase {.myvar}\n\nExample 5\n-----\n\t.var {myvar} {hello!}\n\t.myvar::uppercase\n\nHELLO!\n\nGenerally speaking, .a::b is transformed into .b {.a}, .a::b::c into .c {.b {.a}}, and so on.\n\nYou can append additional arguments to any function in the chain. Just keep in mind that the chained value is always the first argument, positionally speaking, of the next call.\n\nExample 6\n-----\n.a {x}::b {y} is transformed into .b {.a {x}} {y}:\n\n\t.sum {10} {5}::multiply {2}\n\n30\n\nMany core functions are designed to be called in a chain, for example None operations.\n\nBlock vs. inline function calls\n\nFunction calls can appear in two contexts: inline or block.\n\nInline calls\n\nAn inline function call is preceded and/or followed by other inline content, such as text. The output of an inline function call is simply replaced in the parent’s block.\n\nExample 7\n-----\n\tEver wondered what **26+16** equals? It's .sum {26} {16}. Here you go.\n\nEver wondered what 26+16 equals? It’s 42. Here you go.\n\nBlock calls\n\nA block function call is an isolated one. For context, in Markdown, a block is a paragraph, a code snippet, a quote, a list, and so on.\n\n\tParagraph 1\n\t.myfunction {arg1} {arg2}\n\tParagraph 2\n\nThe body argument\n\nThe main difference between inline and block function calls is a special argument called body argument. This argument always refers to the last parameter of the signature (even if named arguments were used).\n\nA body argument expands over multiple lines, is not wrapped by brackets, and requires each line to be indented by at least two spaces or one tab:\n\n\t.myfunction {arg1} {arg2}\n\t    Body argument, line 1\n\t    and line 2.\n\nThe whole body must share the same indentation. The following produces unexpected results, as indentation is inconsistent:\n\n\t.myfunction {arg1} {arg2}\n\t    Body argument, line 1\n\t        and line 2. <!-- This is a 4-spaces indented code block! -->\n\nNesting functions in body arguments\n\nOther functions, block or inline, can be nested inside body arguments:\n\n\t.row alignment:{center}                    <!-- Block  -->\n\t    This document was made by .docauthor   <!-- Inline -->\n\t    .column                                <!-- Block  -->\n\t        The document name is .docname      <!-- Inline -->\n\t        .loremipsum                        <!-- Block  -->\n\nBody arguments and inline calls\n\nWhen nested inside inline arguments, function calls are always inline. Thus, the following is invalid since body arguments are accepted only in block calls:\n\n\t.center {\n\t    .row\n\t        Hi\n\t}\n\nWhile this is valid as .row is called within a body argument:\n\n\t.center\n\t    .row\n\t        Hi","headings":[{"anchor":"basic-syntax","text":"Basic syntax","level":2},{"anchor":"positional-and-named-arguments","text":"Positional and named arguments","level":2},{"anchor":"multi-line-arguments","text":"Multi-line arguments","level":2},{"anchor":"nested-function-calls","text":"Nested function calls","level":2},{"anchor":"chaining-calls","text":"Chaining calls","level":2},{"anchor":"block-vs-inline-function-calls","text":"Block vs. inline function calls","level":2},{"anchor":"inline-calls","text":"Inline calls","level":3},{"anchor":"block-calls","text":"Block calls","level":3},{"anchor":"the-body-argument","text":"The body argument","level":3},{"anchor":"nesting-functions-in-body-arguments","text":"Nesting functions in body arguments","level":3},{"anchor":"body-arguments-and-inline-calls","text":"Body arguments and inline calls","level":3}]},{"url":"/Variables","title":"Variables","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Variables\n\nVariables allow you to store and reuse values throughout your document.

The following snippet shows the full configuration schema, where all entries are optional:\n\n\t.numbering\n\t  - headings: <format>\n\t  - figures: <format>\n\t  - tables: <format>\n\t  - equations: <format>\n\t  - code: <format>\n\t  - footnotes: <format>\n\nEach format parameter accepts either none or a string where each character represents either a counter or a fixed symbol:\n\n- 1 for decimal (1, 2, 3, ...)\n- a for lowercase latin alphabet (a, b, c, ...)\n- A for uppercase latin alphabet (A, B, C, ...)\n- i for lowercase roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)\n- I for uppercase roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)\n- Any other character is a fixed symbol.\n\nDefault formats\n\nThe default numbering format, if unspecified, is:\n\n- For paged documents:\n\t- 1.1.1 for headings\n\t- 1.1 for figures and tables\n\t- (1) for equations\n\t- 1 for footnotes\n\n- \n\n- For plain documents:\n\t- (1) for equations\n\t- 1 for footnotes\n\n- \n\n- For slides and docs documents:\n\t- 1 for footnotes\n\nYou can turn off any active numbering configuration via the .nonumbering function.\n\nMerging configurations\n\nBy default, .numbering enhances the current numbering configuration by merging the new configuration with the existing one. This means only the specified entries are updated while the rest remain unchanged.\n\nTo avoid merging and turn off numbering rules for unspecified entries, set the merge:{no} argument:\n\n\t.numbering merge:{no}\n\t    - figures: 1.1\n\nHeadings\n\nExample 1\n-----\n\t.numbering\n\t    - headings: 1.A.a\n\t## Title    <!--   1   -->\n\t### Title   <!--  1.A  -->\n\t#### Title  <!-- 1.A.a -->\n\t#### Title  <!-- 1.A.b -->\n\t##### Title <!-- None  -->\n\t### Title   <!--  1.B  -->\n\t## Title    <!--   2   -->\n\t### Title   <!--  2.A  -->\n\n\n\nDecorative headings\n\nTo prevent a heading from being numbered, append a ! after the last # sign.

A key string. The element’s number is counted across previous occurrences with the same key.\n2. A lambda block that takes the number as an argument, formatted according to the active numbering format.\n\n\t.numbered {greetings}\n\t    number:\n\t    **Hello!** This block has the number **.number**\n\nExecuting the previous block renders an empty string in place of number because you need to specify the numbering format for greetings in the .numbering call:\n\n\t.numbering\n\t    ...\n\t    - greetings: 1.a\n\nA numbered block can also be cross-referenced. See Cross-references for details.\n\nFull example:\n\nExample 9\n-----\n\t.numbering\n\t    - headings: 1.1\n\t    - greetings: 1.a\n\t## Title 1\n\t.numbered {greetings}\n\t    number:\n\t    **Hello!** This block has the number **.number**\n\t.numbered {greetings}\n\t    number:\n\t    **Hey!** This has instead the number **.number**\n\t## Title 2\n\t.numbered {greetings}\n\t    number:\n\t    **Hi!** Here we have the number **.number**\n\n\n\nLocalization\n\nThe localized name of the labeled element appears in captions if .doclang is set and the locale is supported.

The .marker function creates an invisible level-0 heading, which is not normally possible with the standard #-based syntax.\n\nHere is a practical pattern for chapter slides:\n\n\t.function {chapter}\n\t    name:\n\t    .tableofcontents maxdepth:{0} focus:{.name}\n\t    .marker {.name}\n\nYou can then invoke it with .chapter {My chapter} at the start of each section.

The .includeall function, which takes an Iterable of paths, serves as a convenient shorthand for repeated .include calls.\n\nThe following snippet is from Mock’s main.qd file:\n\n\t.includeall\n\t    - setup.qd\n\t    - headings.qd\n\t    - paragraphs.qd\n\t    - lists.qd\n\t    - images.qd\n\t    - tables.qd\n\t    - code.qd\n\t    - textformatting.qd\n\t    - colorpreview.qd\n\t    - quotes.qd\n\t    - boxes.qd\n\t    - math.qd\n\t    - footnotes.qd\n\t    - mermaid.qd\n\t    - collapsibles.qd\n\t    - errors.qd\n\t    - icons.qd\n\t    - separators.qd\n\t    - alignment.qd\n\t    - stacks.qd\n\t    - crossreferences.qd\n\t    - bibliography.qd\n\t    - localization.qd\n\nYou can also combine the function with .listfiles to automatically include all files in a directory:\n\n\t.includeall {.listfiles {somedirectory} sortby:{name}}\n\nContext sharing\n\nThe .include function’s sandbox parameter lets you control how much isolation the included file has from the main file. The included file always inherits the context of the main file, but you can optionally allow changes in the included file to propagate back.\n\nFor these examples, consider the following files:\n\n> file.qd\n> \n> \t.docname {New name}\n> \t.function {greet}\n> \t  name:\n> \t  Hello, **.name**!\n\n> main.qd\n> \n> \t.docname {My document}\n> \t.include {file.qd} sandbox:{<value>}\n> \t1. .docname\n> \t2. .greet {John}\n\nHere are the available options, in ascending order of isolation:\n\nshare (default)\n\nBoth contexts are synchronized bidirectionally. Any customization, function, variable, and other information declared in the included file will also be available in the main file, and vice versa.\n\n> Output:\n> \n> 1. New name\n> 2. Hello, John!\n\nscope\n\nSimilar to share, but function and variable declarations do not propagate back to the main file.\n\nThis is the same behavior used in nested lambda scopes, such as in .function and .foreach.\n\n> Output:\n> \n> 1. New name\n> 2. Compile error: .greet is not defined.\n\nsubdocument\n\nThe included file is completely isolated from the main file.

In practice, when I do this, I am referring to a subdocument.\n\nEvery project consists of at least one subdocument: the main one, called root.\n\n> Do not confuse subdocuments with inclusion. See Inclusion vs. subdocuments for a comparison.\n\nReferencing subdocuments\n\nWhenever a Markdown link points to a local .qd or .md file, it is considered a reference to a subdocument.\n\n\t[My subdocument](file.qd)\n\nEquivalently, you can use the .subdocument {path} {label?}  function:\n\n\t.subdocument {file.qd} label:{My subdocument}\n\nUnlike the link syntax, the function accepts dynamic paths, making it suitable for more complex use cases. For instance, you can use it in combination with .listfiles to automatically link all documents in a directory through a for-each loop:\n\n\t.foreach {.listfiles {pages} sortby:{date} order:{descending}}\n\t    path:\n\t    .subdocument {.path} label:{.path::filename}\n\nQuarkdown makes sure a file is evaluated only once, so circular and recursive references are handled gracefully.\n\nContext inheritance\n\nWhen referencing a subdocument, its content is evaluated like an independent Quarkdown document.\n\nA relevant difference is that subdocuments inherit the referrer’s context: document metadata, customizations, functions, variables, and more.\n\nExample 1\n-----\n> main.qd:\n> \n> \t.doctype {paged}\n> \t.theme {darko}\n> \t.pageformat margin:{1cm}\n> \t.function {greet}\n> \t    Hello!\n> \t[Introduction](introduction.qd)\n\n> introduction.qd:\n> \n> \tNo need to set the document up again, it's already inherited!\n> \t.greet\n\nUnlike .include, the context is inherited, not shared: changes made in the subdocument do not affect the referrer.\n\nExample 2\n-----\nThe following example produces an error because greet is not defined in the referrer context:\n\n> main.qd:\n> \n> \t[Introduction](introduction.qd)\n> \t.greet <!-- Error: unresolved -->\n\n> introduction.qd:\n> \n> \t.function {greet}\n> \t    Hello!\n\nWorking directory\n\nThe working directory of a subdocument is relative to the subdocument’s entry point, not the referrer:\n\n\tmain.qd\n\tpages/\n\t| introduction.qd\n\timages/\n\t| image.png\n\nWhereas main.qd can reference images/image.png, introduction.qd should reference it as ../images/image.png.\n\n> The media storage system can still store media files across subdocuments.\n\nSubdocument graph\n\nSubdocuments are structured in a directed graph, where the edges are the links between them.\n\nYou can visualize the graph via the .subdocumentgraph function:\n\nOutput\n\nSubdocuments are exported differently depending on the output target.\n\nHTML\n\nEach subdocument is exported as a separate subdirectory in the same directory as index.html.\n\nConfiguration resources, such as themes and runtime scripts, are generated only once. Media is stored per subdocument instead.\n\n\tMyDocument/\n\t|  media/\n\t|  theme/\n\t|  script/\n\t|  introduction/\n\t|  |  media/\n\t|  |  index.html\n\t|  conclusion/\n\t|  |  media/\n\t|  |  index.html\n\t|  index.html\n\nPDF\n\nEach subdocument is exported as a separate PDF file.\n\n\tMyDocument/\n\t| index.pdf\n\t| introduction.pdf\n\t| conclusion.pdf\n\n> Subdocument links in PDF output are not navigable yet.\n\nIf only the root subdocument is present, then only MyDocument.pdf is generated without the need for a directory.\n\nMinimizing name collisions\n\nSince the subdocument output files lie flatly in the same directory, it is possible that two subdocuments with the same name but from different directories end up colliding.\n\nBy default, Quarkdown accepts this collision-prone behavior in order to generate human-readable URLs.\n\nIf collisions cannot be avoided, launching the compiler with the --no-subdoc-collisions flag will append a hash to the output file names.","headings":[{"anchor":"referencing-subdocuments","text":"Referencing subdocuments","level":2},{"anchor":"context-inheritance","text":"Context inheritance","level":2},{"anchor":"working-directory","text":"Working directory","level":2},{"anchor":"subdocument-graph","text":"Subdocument graph","level":2},{"anchor":"output","text":"Output","level":2},{"anchor":"html","text":"HTML","level":3},{"anchor":"pdf","text":"PDF","level":3},{"anchor":"minimizing-name-collisions","text":"Minimizing name collisions","level":3}]},{"url":"/Localization","title":"Localization","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Localization\n\nQuarkdown supports string localization out of the box.\n\nThe first step is to set the document language via .doclang {locale}.

This is where localization tables come in.\n\nThe .localization {name} function defines a new localization table associated with a unique name. Its body parameter accepts a particular Markdown list that, in Quarkdown, is called a dictionary.\n\nThis localization dictionary exposes key-value pairs for each locale that you intend to support. The locale names follow the same rules as those from .doclang, meaning they can be full names or tags. As long as .doclang is set, you can access the localized string via .localize {table:key}, in this case .localize {mylib:theorem}.\n\nExample 2\n-----\nThe previous function would now look like this:\n\n\t.localization name:{mylib}\n\t    - English\n\t      - theorem: Theorem\n\t    - Italian\n\t      - theorem: Teorema\n\t.function {theorem}\n\t    **.localize {mylib:theorem}.**\n\t.theorem This is my theorem\n\nTheorem.

Any conflicting entries will be replaced by the new ones.\n\nFor instance, typed boxes feature a localized title by default, such as Warning for a warning-typed box. If the document locale is not supported, the title will be missing. To extend the built-in localization with box titles in Canadian French, use the following approach:\n\n\t.localization {std} merge:{yes}\n\t    - fr-CA\n\t      - warning: Avertissement\n\t      - error: Erreur\n\t      ...\n\nAfter that, assuming Canadian French is set in .doclang, the new entries will be available to the .box function.\n\nBuilt-in table names and entries are listed in this page’s Built-in localization.","headings":[{"anchor":"built-in-localization","text":"Built-in localization","level":2},{"anchor":"creating-your-own-localized-strings","text":"Creating your own localized strings","level":2},{"anchor":"extending-a-built-in-localization-table","text":"Extending a built-in localization table","level":2}]},{"url":"/Document-metadata","title":"Document metadata","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Document metadata\n\nYou can set document information using the following functions.

When the ends of the range need to be evaluated dynamically, such as through a mathematical operation, .range is the appropriate choice.\n\nExample 1\n-----\n\t.code\n\t    .read {assets/Point.ts}\n\n\texport class Point {\n\t    x: number;\n\t    y: number;\n\t    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n\t        this.x = x;\n\t        this.y = y;\n\t    }\n\t}\n\nExample 2\n-----\n\t.code\n\t    .read {assets/Point.ts} lines:{5..7}\n\n\t    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n\t        this.x = x;\n\t        this.y = y;\n\nExample 3\n-----\n\t.code \n\t    .read {assets/Point.ts} lines:{..3}\n\n\texport class Point {\n\t    x: number;\n\t    y: number;\n\nExample 4\n-----\n\t.code\n\t    .read {assets/Point.ts} lines:{5..}\n\n\t    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n\t        this.x = x;\n\t        this.y = y;\n\t    }\n\t}","headings":[]},{"url":"/Lambda","title":"Lambda","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Lambda\n\nA lambda is a block of code that maps a variable number of parameters into a single output value of any type (see the Value types section of this wiki).\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n\tparam1 param2 param3:\n\tMy code\n\nThe param1 param2 param3: portion is the header of the lambda, where you define parameter names.

This object can represent any supported type, and it carries the information needed to convert itself to the expected type when required.\n\nThe dynamic value is then adapted or converted to the type expected by the signature of the native function (written in Kotlin, which is strongly typed) at invocation time. If a conversion cannot be made, an error occurs.\n\nThis invoke-time adaptation reduces constraints, allowing the same value to be handled differently depending on its context.\n\nExample 1\n-----\n\t.var {myvar} {true}\n\t.if {.myvar}\n\t    My value is .uppercase {.myvar}\n\nMy value is TRUE\n\nIn the previous example:\n\n- .var’s signature accepts a DynamicValue.\n- .if takes a Boolean, so the dynamic true value kept in the myvar variable is converted to boolean.\n- .uppercase takes a String, so the true value is used as a string.\n\nSee the Value types section of this wiki to see all supported types.\n\nExample: source + result\n\nThe following example is a simplified version of a function defined in this wiki, which shows a Quarkdown code snippet and its visual result right below it:\n\nExample 2\n-----\n\t.function {sourceresult}\n\t    source:\n\t    .code {markdown}\n\t        .source\n\t    .source\n\t.sourceresult\n\t    ##!

The .code function, on the other hand, accepts any Quarkdown string as its body parameter, which means you can evaluate functions before displaying their output as code. This is particularly useful when combining .code with .read to load a code snippet from a file:\n\nExample 3\n-----\n\t.code\n\t    .read {assets/Point.ts}\n\n\texport class Point {\n\t    x: number;\n\t    y: number;\n\t    constructor(x: number, y: number) {\n\t        this.x = x;\n\t        this.y = y;\n\t    }\n\t}\n\nLanguage specification\n\nStandard fenced code blocks specify their language right after the opening delimiter, for example ```markdown.\n\nThe .code function specifies the language through the optional lang argument, for example .code {markdown} or .code lang:{markdown}.

An invalid or out-of-bounds range causes an error.

For example, you can perform automatic bulk inclusions via .includeall:\n\n\t.includeall {.listfiles {somedirectory} sortby:{name}}\n\nGetting a file name\n\nThe .filename {path} {extension?}  function returns the file name from a given file path.

You can delete the existing content inside the first section if you want to start fresh.\n\n\t## Quickstart\n\t- Welcome to [Quarkdown](https://quarkdown.com)!\n\t- This is the starting point of your document.\n\t- ...\n\nChoosing a document type\n\n> Reference: Document types\n\nDuring the initial setup, you choose a document type from one of the following options:\n\n- plain: A continuous flow layout similar to Notion or Obsidian, ideal for knowledge management and web viewing.\n- paged: A traditional document layout with page breaks, perfect for PDFs.\n- slides: A presentation format with interactive navigation.\n\nChoosing a theme\n\n> Reference: Themes\n\nThemes are split into two groups: color themes define the color scheme of a document, while layout themes set the general structural rules of the layout.\n\n\t.theme {paperwhite} layout:{latex}\n\nSome popular combinations include:\n\n- paperwhite + latex: A clean academic look (this is the default)\n- darko + minimal: A dark theme with minimal styling\n- beaver + beamer: An academic presentation style\n\nSee Themes for a complete list of available themes.\n\nCompiling\n\n> Reference: Compiler\n\nCompile the document to make sure everything works as expected:\n\n\tcd my-document\n\tquarkdown c my-document.qd\n\nYou should see the HTML output inside the output directory.\n\nTo export to PDF, add the --pdf flag:\n\n\tquarkdown c my-document.qd --pdf\n\nSee the PDF export page for more information about PDF export and its requirements. If you installed Quarkdown using a package manager or the install script, you should be ready to go.\n\nLive preview\n\nTo launch live preview, append -p (preview) and -w (watch) to the compile command:\n\n\tquarkdown c my-document.qd -p -w\n\nThis opens the default browser automatically. To use a different browser, specify it with the --browser option, for example --browser chrome.\n\nIf you use VS Code with the Quarkdown extension, you can launch the live preview by clicking the magnifying glass button or pressing Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+V.\n\nMarkup\n\nQuarkdown builds upon Markdown and includes several GFM extensions. To try out basic markup, append the following to your document and experiment with it:\n\n\t### A Quarkdown tour\n\tNo need to reinvent the wheel: you can make text **bold** or *italic*,\n\t~~strike through~~, add `inline code`,\n\tcreate [links](https://quarkdown.com), and much more.\n\t- An unordered list\n\t- With multiple items\n\t1. An ordered list\n\t2. With multiple items\n\t![Logo](image/logo.png)\n\nFor a refresher on Markdown basics, see markdownguide.org.\n\nImage size\n\n> References: Image size, Size\n\nYou might have noticed that the image in the previous example appears too large. Quarkdown overcomes this well-known Markdown limitation by allowing you to specify image dimensions:\n\n\t!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png)\n\nNow the image is sized appropriately.\n\nThis sets the image width to 50% of the available width while maintaining the aspect ratio. Supported units include px, pt, cm, mm, in, and %. If you omit the unit, Quarkdown assumes px.\n\nTo specify both width and height:\n\n\t!(6cm 2cm)[Logo](image/logo.png)\n\nTo specify only the height:\n\n\t!(_ 2cm)[Logo](image/logo.png)\n\nFigures\n\n> Reference: Figures\n\nWhen an image stands alone, separated from other content, it automatically becomes a figure. Figures are centered and can have a caption.\n\nTake the previous image:\n\n\t!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png)\n\nYou can add a caption by appending a title in quotes:\n\n\t!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png \"The Quarkdown logo\")\n\nEquations and formulae\n\n> Reference: TeX formulae\n\nYou can include TeX equations using the $ expression $ syntax. Note that whitespace matters.\n\nAdd the following to the bottom of your document:\n\n\t#### Equations\n\t$ E = mc^2 $ is Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula.\n\t$ f(x, y) = \\frac{x}{y} $\n\nNotice that the second equation appears centered on its own line, even though it uses the same syntax. Just like figures, isolated equations automatically become block equations.\n\nFunction call syntax\n\n> Reference: Syntax of a function call\n\nBefore exploring more features, let’s look at Quarkdown’s function call syntax.\n\nFunction calls start with a dot and use curly braces for arguments. Arguments can be positional or named:\n\n\t.pow {5} to:{2} is a mathematical operation.\n\nFunction calls can be inline or block, depending on whether they appear within other content or stand alone.\n\nBlock function calls also support an indented block argument, which always corresponds to the last parameter of the function:\n\n\t.align {center}\n\t    This multi-line paragraph is the block argument,\n\t    and it's now centered in the document.\n\nYou can chain multiple function calls together, where the output of one becomes the first argument of the next:\n\nExample 1\n-----\n\t.sqrt {10}::round::multiply {2}\n\n6\n\n> you can find a full list of available functions in the documentation.\n\nVariables\n\n> Reference: Variables\n\nDefine a variable using the .var function and access it like any other function:\n\n\t.var {name} {John}\n\tMy name is .name\n\nTo change a variable’s value, call it with a new argument:\n\n\t.name {Jane}\n\nCustom elements\n\n> Reference: Declaring functions, Boxes\n\nYou can define custom functions using .function. Functions are reusable components that encapsulate logic and content. In this section, we create a function that generates an Example box, commonly used in educational documents.\n\nStart by defining a function without parameters:\n\n\t.docauthors\n\t    - ...\n\t.function {example}\n\t    .box {Example} type:{tip}\n\t        This is my example!\n\t## Quickstart\n\t...\n\nNow call it:\n\n\t## Quickstart\n\t.example\n\t...\n\nCalling .example produces a nicely formatted box.\n\nLet’s enhance the function by adding a parameter for the box content. The syntax for parameters is param1 param2 param3:.\n\n\t.function {example}\n\t    content:\n\t    .box {Example} type:{tip}\n\t        .content\n\nUpdate the call accordingly:\n\n\t.example\n\t    This is my example!\n\nCongratulations! You’ve created your first reusable element using boxes. Many more layout tools are available, such as containers and stacks.\n\nFor advanced styling of custom elements, you can use CSS rules. See CSS for more information.\n\n> For the sake of simplicity, let’s remove the function call for now:\n> \n> \t- .example\n> \t-    This is my example!\n\nNumbering\n\n> Reference: Numbering\n\nMany documents, especially academic ones, require numbered elements such as sections, figures, tables, equations, and code. In Quarkdown, you can achieve this using the .numbering function.\n\n> Documents with the paged type come with default numbering enabled.\n\nAdd a numbering scheme at the top of your document, right before the content begins:\n\n\t.docauthors\n\t    - ...\n\t.numbering\n\t    - headings: 1.1.1\n\t    - figures: 1.1\n\t.function {example}\n\t    ...\n\t## Quickstart\n\t...\n\n> This YAML-like syntax represents a dictionary data type.\n\nValid symbols for numbering formats are:\n\n- 1 for decimal numbers\n- A for uppercase letters\n- a for lowercase letters\n- I for uppercase Roman numerals\n- i for lowercase Roman numerals\n\nAny other character is treated as literal text.\n\nTable of contents\n\n> Reference: Table of contents\n\nLonger documents often include a table of contents at the beginning that lists all sections and subsections.\n\nIn Quarkdown, simply call the .tableofcontents function where you want the table of contents to appear:\n\n\t.numbering\n\t    - ...\n\t.tableofcontents\n\t## Quickstart\n\t...\n\nFootnotes\n\n> Reference: Footnotes\n\nFootnotes let you add additional information without cluttering the main text. Let’s add a footnote to our introduction:\n\n\t### A Quarkdown tour\n\tNo need to reinvent the wheel: you can make text **bold** or *italic*,\n\t~~strike through~~, add `inline code`,\n\tcreate [links](https://quarkdown.com), and much more[^1].\n\t[^1]: All Markdown features are supported in Quarkdown\n\nThis is the GFM footnote syntax, which Quarkdown fully supports. Quarkdown also supports compact footnotes, which let you define a footnote inline, right where you reference it:\n\n\tand much more[^: All Markdown features are supported in Quarkdown].\n\nIn plain documents, footnotes appear in the margin next to the reference, similar to side notes. In paged and slides documents, footnotes appear at the bottom of the page or slide.\n\nCross-references\n\n> Reference: Cross-references\n\nCross-references let you refer to numbered elements elsewhere in your document.\n\nFirst, add an ID to the target element. Then reference it using the .ref {id} function.\n\nTake our figure:\n\n\t!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png \"The Quarkdown logo\")\n\nAdd the logo ID to it and reference it in the text:\n\n\t!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png \"The Quarkdown logo\") {#logo}\n\tThe Quarkdown logo is shown in .ref {logo}.\n\nSee Cross-references to learn how to add IDs to other elements, such as sections, tables, equations, and code blocks.\n\nPage margins and counter\n\n> References: Page format, Page margin content, Page counter\n\nIn paged and slides documents, you typically want a page counter to help readers navigate and understand where they are in the document.\n\nFirst, switch to the paged document type by changing the .doctype value at the top of your document:\n\n\t- .doctype {plain}\n\t+ .doctype {paged}\n\n> The default page format is A4. You can change it, along with other properties, using the .pageformat function:\n> \n> \t.pageformat {letter} margin:{2cm}\n\nNow add a page counter to the bottom center of each page:\n\n\t.docauthors\n\t    - ...\n\t.pagemargin {bottomcenter}\n\t    .currentpage / .totalpages\n\t.numbering\n\t    - ...\n\nEach page now displays its number and the total number of pages.\n\nThe .pagemargin function can add any kind of content to each page. See Page margin content for all available margin positions.\n\nPersistent headings\n\n> Reference: Persistent headings\n\nPage margins can also display the current section title on each page. The following example shows the current level-1 heading in the bottom left margin:\n\n\t.pagemargin {bottomcenter}\n\t    ...\n\t.pagemargin {bottomleft}\n\t    .lastheading depth:{1}\n\t.numbering\n\t    - ...\n\nMulti-file projects\n\n> Reference: Inclusion vs. subdocuments\n\nThere are two main ways to split a large document into multiple source files: inclusion and subdocuments.\n\nIncluding files\n\n> Reference: Including other Quarkdown files\n\nThe .include function inserts the content of another Quarkdown file into the current one. This approach is common in LaTeX and other markup languages for splitting a large document into smaller, more manageable files, such as one per chapter or section.\n\nFor our quickstart, we could split setup and content into two separate files:\n\n> my-document.qd\n\n\t- .docname {Quickstart}\n\t- .doctype {paged}\n\t- .doclang {English}\n\t- .theme {paperwhite} layout:{latex}\n\t-\n\t- .docauthors\n\t-     - ...\n\t-\n\t- .pagemargin {bottomright}\n\t-     .currentpage / .totalpages\n\t-\n\t- .pagemargin {bottomleft}\n\t-     .lastheading depth:{1}\n\t-\n\t- .numbering\n\t-     - headings: 1.1.1\n\t-     - figures: 1.1\n\t+ .include {setup.qd}\n\t+ .include {content.qd}\n\t- .tableofcontents\n\t-\n\t- # Quickstart\n\t-\n\t- ...\n\n> setup.qd\n\n\t.docname {MyDocument}\n\t.doctype {paged}\n\t.doclang {English}\n\t.theme {paperwhite} layout:{latex}\n\t.docauthors\n\t    - Quarkdown\n\t.pagemargin {bottomright}\n\t    .currentpage / .totalpages\n\t.numbering\n\t    - headings: 1.1.1\n\t    - figures: 1.1\n\n> content.qd\n\n\t.tableofcontents\n\t## Quickstart\n\t...\n\nHere we used .include twice. For a larger number of files, consider using .includeall instead:\n\n\t.includeall\n\t    - setup.qd\n\t    - content.qd\n\nReferencing files\n\n> Reference: Subdocuments\n\nThe second approach uses subdocuments, which are particularly common for knowledge bases and wikis.\n\nSubdocuments are independent units of content that share the same setup and configuration. You can reference them from other documents through links.\n\n> my-document.qd\n\n\t- [Introduction](introduction.qd)\n\t- [Chapter 1](chapter1.qd)\n\t- [Chapter 2](chapter2.qd)\n\t- [Conclusion](conclusion.qd)\n\nYou can also visualize the knowledge graph formed by subdocuments:\n\n\t.subdocumentgraph\n\nConclusion\n\nCongratulations! You have completed the Quarkdown quickstart guide and are now familiar with its main features. You are ready to create your first real document.\n\nFrom here, you can explore more advanced topics in the rest of this wiki and in the documentation.","headings":[{"anchor":"creating-a-document","text":"Creating a document","level":2},{"anchor":"choosing-a-document-type","text":"Choosing a document type","level":3},{"anchor":"choosing-a-theme","text":"Choosing a theme","level":3},{"anchor":"compiling","text":"Compiling","level":2},{"anchor":"live-preview","text":"Live preview","level":2},{"anchor":"markup","text":"Markup","level":2},{"anchor":"image-size","text":"Image size","level":3},{"anchor":"figures","text":"Figures","level":3},{"anchor":"equations-and-formulae","text":"Equations and formulae","level":3},{"anchor":"function-call-syntax","text":"Function call syntax","level":2},{"anchor":"variables","text":"Variables","level":3},{"anchor":"custom-elements","text":"Custom elements","level":2},{"anchor":"numbering","text":"Numbering","level":2},{"anchor":"table-of-contents","text":"Table of contents","level":2},{"anchor":"footnotes","text":"Footnotes","level":2},{"anchor":"cross-references","text":"Cross-references","level":2},{"anchor":"page-margins-and-counter","text":"Page margins and counter","level":2},{"anchor":"persistent-headings","text":"Persistent headings","level":3},{"anchor":"multi-file-projects","text":"Multi-file projects","level":2},{"anchor":"including-files","text":"Including files","level":3},{"anchor":"referencing-files","text":"Referencing files","level":3},{"anchor":"conclusion","text":"Conclusion","level":2}]},{"url":"/Media-storage","title":"Media storage","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Media storage\n\nMedia storage is a feature that ensures all required files are present in the output directory when you export a Quarkdown project.\n\nHere is what it does:\n\n1. Keeps track of external files (media) referenced in a Quarkdown document through image and reference image nodes\n2. Copies each media file to the media directory inside the output directory\n3. Updates the image nodes to point their source path to the newly created file\n\n> Source:\n> \n> \t![Image](../my-img.png)\n> \n> Result:\n> \n> \t<img src=\"media/my-img@HASH.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\n\nMedia storage is enabled by default. You can turn it off via the --no-media-storage flag.\n\nWhy\n\nTake HTML as an example: images from remote URLs load effortlessly, while local ones (e.g., ../my-img.png) require the image file to be present on the server at the exact same location.\n\nImagine writing a Quarkdown document, typing ![Image](my-img.png), with my-img.png located in the same directory as your Quarkdown source. You would expect it to work, but as soon as you compile the project and open your HTML artifact, you notice the browser cannot find the file simply because it is not there.\n\nThanks to the media storage system, all media files are carried around with your output.\n\nOptions\n\nThe storage can handle both local and remote files. The rules that determine which types are allowed in the storage are set by the active renderer.\n\n- When rendering to HTML, storage is enabled for local files only.\n- On the other hand, LaTeX (which is not yet supported but might be in the future) also requires remote media to be downloaded locally.\n\nOverriding these rules is supported, although currently unavailable via CLI.","headings":[{"anchor":"why","text":"Why","level":2},{"anchor":"options","text":"Options","level":2}]},{"url":"/Slides-speaker-notes","title":"Slides speaker notes","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Slides speaker notes\n\nSpeaker notes are helpful tools for remembering talking points, reminders, or extra details while presenting.\n\nCalling the .speakernote function adds a speaker note to the current slide.

When this happens, the server broadcasts a reload message to all connected browsers.\n\nLive preview wrapper\n\nWhen serving a file through the /live/:file endpoint, the server wraps HTML files in a simple HTML wrapper that displays the content of /:file in an iframe.\n\nAdditionally, a small script establishes a persistent WebSocket connection to the /reload endpoint. This script listens for reload messages and triggers a reload of the iframe content when it receives one.\n\nDouble buffering\n\nWhen an iframe reloads, an unpleasant flickering effect can occur. To provide a smooth user experience, Quarkdown employs a technique called double buffering.\n\nFor context, you encounter double buffering constantly in everyday computing: your GPU renders the next frame to an off-screen buffer while displaying the current frame. Once the next frame is ready, the buffers swap, resulting in a smooth transition without flickering.\n\nQuarkdown applies the same principle by maintaining two iframes, A and B. Suppose A is currently visible. When a change is detected, Quarkdown renders the updated content into B while A remains on screen. Once the rendering completes, the visible iframe switches from A to B, providing a seamless update.\n\nBefore swapping the buffers, the system also preserves the scroll position from the previous frame and restores it in the new frame, so you do not lose your place in the document.","headings":[{"anchor":"live-preview-wrapper","text":"Live preview wrapper","level":2},{"anchor":"double-buffering","text":"Double buffering","level":3}]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Lexing","title":"Pipeline - Lexing","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Lexing\n\n> Main packages: core.lexer\n\nLexing is like breaking down a sentence into its individual words before figuring out the meaning of the sentence. Imagine you are reading a paragraph, and before understanding the message, you first recognize individual words like nouns, verbs, and punctuation.\n\nIn Quarkdown, the lexing process scans a source file, which is nothing but a sequence of characters, and splits it into small pieces called tokens. Each token represents a different element, like a heading, a paragraph, or bold text, and stores basic information such as its type, its position in the text, and its textual content (lexeme).\n\nMarkdown recognizes two macro-categories of tokens: block tokens and inline tokens. The difference is based on how these elements are structured in the document:\n\n- Blocks are sections that define the outer structure of a document. For example, a paragraph, a list, a heading, a code block, or a quote.\n\t\t# A heading\n\t\tA paragraph\n\t\t> A quote\n\t\t- A list\n\t\t- of multiple items\n\n- \n\n- Inlines are elements that appear inside blocks and define, most commonly, textual features such as formatting. For example, bold, italics, monospaced, links, and images.\n\t\tA **formatted** _text_.\n\nTo accomplish this separation, two distinct lexers are supplied: a block lexer and an inline lexer, which extract their corresponding tokens.\n\nFunction calls are extracted both as blocks and inlines, with just a few differences between them.\n\nAt the beginning, only the block lexer is invoked. Once the source is broken down into its outer blocks, they are passed to the parser, which is delegated to search for nested information.","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Parsing","title":"Pipeline - Parsing","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Parsing\n\n> Main packages: core.parser, core.ast\n\nContinuing with the metaphor introduced in Lexing, once the nouns, verbs, and adjectives are extracted from a sentence, our brain is responsible for linking them together to build information out of them.\n\nThe parser takes the sequence of tokens and organizes them into a tree structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which defines the relationships between different parts of the document. Each element of the tree is called a Node.\n\n-----\n\nExample Markdown input:\n\n\t## Title\n\tThis is **bold** and _italic_ text.\n\t- Item 1\n\t- Item 2\n\nOutput AST:\n\n- AstRoot\n\t- Heading(depth=1)\n\t\t- Text(\"Title\")\n\t- Paragraph\n\t\t- Text(\"This is \")\n\t\t- Strong(\"bold\")\n\t\t- Text(\" and \")\n\t\t- Emphasis(\"italic\")\n\t\t- Text(\" text\")\n\t- UnorderedList\n\t\t- ListItem\n\t\t\t- Paragraph\n\t\t\t\t- Text(\"Item 1\")\n\t\t- ListItem\n\t\t\t- Paragraph\n\t\t\t\t- Text(\"Item 2\")\n\n-----\n\nThe lexing stage produces just the outer blocks, which in this example are a HeadingToken, a ParagraphToken, and an UnorderedListToken.\n\nTo gain nested information, the parser analyzes each token and starts searching in depth for nested blocks and inlines.\n\n- For each block token, the parser triggers the lexing stage on its inner content (lexeme)\n- Once the inner tokens are extracted, they undergo the parsing stage again\n- This process continues until no more nested tokens remain. This is called recursive parsing, visualized in the following figure:","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Function-call-expansion","title":"Pipeline - Function call expansion","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Function call expansion\n\n> Main packages: core.function\n\nAmong the nodes generated from the Parsing stage, those of type FunctionCallNode(context, name, arguments) represent function calls.\n\nWhile all other nodes never change after they are created, this is the only kind of mutable node, which means its inner data is expected to change after the AST has been fully generated. Its mutation affects its child nodes, which is initially an empty collection that is later populated by a component called function call expander.\n\nBefore addressing the expansion itself, we should understand how data is exchanged among functions. Quarkdown functions, either explicitly or implicitly, always return a Value, a type-checked object wrapper.\n\nIn Quarkdown, not all types can be returned and not all types can be used as arguments. Therefore, functions should feature InputValue parameters and return an OutputValue. A complete set of value types is visualized in the following Venn-UML diagram:\n\nWhenever a function returns some OutputValue, it must be converted to some Node that can be rendered on screen. For instance, a StringValue becomes text, an OrderedCollectionValue becomes an ordered list, a BooleanValue becomes a checkbox, a DictionaryValue becomes a table, and so on. This operation is handled by a value-node mapper.\n\nFor each function call node enqueued by the parser, the corresponding function is looked up among loaded libraries, argument-parameter bindings are established, and the function is executed to obtain its output.\nAfter retrieving the output node from the mapper, the expander can push it to the function call’s child nodes, ready for the next stage.","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Tree-traversal","title":"Pipeline - Tree traversal","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Tree traversal\n\n> Main packages: core.ast.iterator, core.context.hooks\n\nAfter the function calls have been expanded, the AST is traversed depth-first to gather enriched information about the document, such as:\n\n- Heading hierarchy, used for the table of contents\n- Numbering: each heading, figure, and other numbered element is assigned a unique number based on its location in the heading hierarchy\n- Link definition bound to each link reference\n\nFor performance reasons, only one traversal is performed during this stage. Each operation can however act independently by attaching its own hook to the tree iterator, which is triggered when nodes of a certain kind are encountered.","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Rendering","title":"Pipeline - Rendering","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Rendering\n\n> Main packages: core.rendering\n> \n> Rendering modules: quarkdown-html, quarkdown-plaintext\n\nOnce the AST is fully generated and enriched, it is time to translate it into a target format, such as HTML.\n\nThis translation is performed via a depth-first traversal of the AST, starting from the root. Each visit to a node produces some output (in the case of HTML, an element tag) which, ideally in a one-to-one fashion, translates the information stored by the node into the target format.\n\nTo ensure scalability, Quarkdown locates each rendering target in external modules, such as quarkdown-html, which can be plugged into the core architecture.\n\n-----\n\nExample Markdown input:\n\n\t## Title\n\tThis is **bold** and _italic_ text.\n\t- Item 1\n\t- Item 2\n\nOutput HTML:\n\n\t<h1>Title</h1>\n\t<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text.</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t  <li>Item 1</li>\n\t  <li>Item 2</li>\n\t</ul>","headings":[]},{"url":"/Pipeline---Post-rendering","title":"Pipeline - Post rendering","description":null,"keywords":[],"content":"Pipeline - Post rendering\n\n> Main packages: core.rendering, core.template, core.pipeline.output\n> \n> Rendering modules: quarkdown-html\n\nAfter obtaining the translation of the AST to the target format from the Renderer, you might notice that it is not enough to display to the user.

Each target requires different scripts and stylesheets\n- User-defined properties, such as title and page format\n- The need to load certain libraries, such as MathJax for rendering LaTeX formulas. This is only done if at least one formula is used\n\nOn top of that, the post-renderer is also responsible for returning the output resources of the compilation. These resources include:\n\n- The generated HTML\n- The group of stylesheets (global stylesheet, layout theme, and color theme)\n- The group of required runtime scripts\n\nThese resources are then added to those provided by the media storage and ultimately returned by the pipeline.\nIt is then up to the invoker to handle those resources, which in the case of CLI are saved to file.","headings":[]}]}
