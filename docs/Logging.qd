Quarkdown provides several ways to log content to standard channels, which can be useful for debugging and error handling.

- **`.log {message}`** logs a message to stdout at the *info* level. This output appears when you run the compiler with `-Dloglevel=info` or a lower threshold.

- **`.debug {message}`** logs a message to stdout at the *debug* level. This output appears when you run the compiler with `-Dloglevel=debug` or a lower threshold.

- **`.error {message}`** throws a runtime error, which the error manager then handles according to the current mode:
  - By default, the error message is logged to stderr (when `-Dloglevel=error` or a lower threshold is set) and an error [box](Box.qd) appears in the document.
  - If you launch the CLI in strict mode (`--strict`), a full stack trace is logged to stderr and the program exits.
