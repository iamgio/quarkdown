.docname {Cross references}
.include {_Setup.qd}

In typesetting, cross-references are references to other parts of the document, such as figures, tables, sections, and equations.

In Quarkdown, you create a cross-reference using the **`.ref {id}`** function, where `id` is the cross-reference ID of the target element. The function can appear either before or after the target element.

> [!NOTE]
> Cross-referencing works best when elements are numbered and you have set a supported document language.
> See [Numbering](Numbering.qd) and [Localization](Localization.qd) for details.

You typically set the ID using the `{#id}` syntax. The exact location depends on the element type, as the following sections explain. For this guide, assume the `1.1` numbering format is used for all elements.



### Sections

```markdown
Once Quarkdown is installed, check out .ref {getting-started} for a quick guide.

## Getting started {#getting-started}
```

> [!TIP]
> In HTML rendering, the reference ID of headings also becomes the HTML `id` attribute, which makes them suitable for linking.



### Figures

```markdown
The Quarkdown logo is shown in .ref {logo}.

![Logo](icon.svg "The Quarkdown icon") {#logo}
```

### Tables

```markdown
As shown in .ref {data}, coffee is the most popular beverage.

| Person | Beverage |
|--------|----------|
| Alice  | Tea      |
| Bob    | Coffee   |
| Charlie| Coffee   |
{#data}
```

With a [caption](Table-caption.qd):

```markdown
| Person | Beverage |
|--------|----------|
| Alice  | Tea      |
| Bob    | Coffee   |
| Charlie| Coffee   |
"Beverage preferences" {#data}
```



### Equations

```markdown
Einstein's famous equation is shown in .ref {energy}.

$ E = mc^2 $ {#energy}
```

For multi-line equations:

```markdown
$$$ {#energy}
E = mc^2
$$$
```

### Code blocks (listings)

~~~markdown
See the main function in .ref {main}.

```kotlin {#main}
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```
~~~

~~~markdown
```kotlin "Hello World in Kotlin" {#main}
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### Custom numbered elements

> The `.numbered` function is explained in detail in [Numbering](Numbering.qd#custom-numbered-elements).

```markdown
In Example .ref {my-example} you can see a custom numbered element.

.numbered {examples} ref:{my-example}
    number:
    **Example .number:** this is a custom numbered element.
```
