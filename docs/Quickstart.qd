.docname {Quickstart}
.include {_Setup.qd}

Welcome to Quarkdown! In this page, we'll explore the main steps and features that will help you create your first document.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using VS Code, we strongly recommend installing
> the [official Quarkdown extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarkdown.quarkdown-vscode).

This guide provides a shallow overview and won't go into the specific details of each feature. In each section you'll find links to other wiki pages for in-depth explanations of relevant features we'll be using.



## Creating a document

> Reference: [Project Creator](CLI-Project-creator.qd)

To create a new document, run the project creator from your terminal:

```shell
quarkdown create my-document
```

This will create a new folder named `my-document`.
If you wish to use the working directory instead, you can omit the name.

For this quickstart, we recommend the following options:

- Project name: `Quickstart`
- Authors: \<your name>
- Document type: `plain`
- Document language: `English`

Once the project is created, open `my-document.qd` in your favorite text editor.

You may also delete the existing content inside the first section.

```diff
## Quickstart

- Welcome to [Quarkdown](https://quarkdown.com)!
- This is the starting point of your document.
- ...
```

### Choosing a document type

> Reference: [Document types](Document-types.qd)

During the initial setup, you'll be asked to choose a document type, which can be one of the following:

- **`plain`** - Continuous flow like Notion/Obsidian, great for knowledge management and web viewing.
- **`paged`** - Traditional document with page breaks, ideal for PDFs.
- **`slides`** - Presentation format with interactive navigation.

### Choosing a theme

> Reference: [Themes](Themes.qd)

Themes are split into two groups: *color* themes, which define the color scheme of a document, and *layout* themes, which set the general structural rules of the layout.

```
.theme {paperwhite} layout:{latex}
```

Popular combinations are:

- `paperwhite + latex` - Clean academic look (default)
- `darko + minimal` - Dark theme with minimal styling
- `beaver + beamer` - Academic presentation style

See [Themes](Themes.qd) for a complete list of available themes.



## Compiling

> Reference: [Compiler](CLI-Compiler.qd)

Compile the document to ensure everything is working as expected:

```shell
cd my-document
quarkdown c my-document.qd
```

You should see the HTML output inside the `output` directory. Great!

To export to PDF:

```shell
quarkdown c my-document.qd --pdf
```

See the [PDF export](PDF-export.qd) page for more information about PDF export and its requirements.
If you installed Quarkdown via a package manager or install script, you should be all set.



## Live preview

To launch live preview, append `-p` (preview) and `-w` (watch) to the compile command:

```shell
quarkdown c my-document.qd -p -w
```

This launches the default browser by default.
To use a different one, use, for example, `--browser chrome`.

If you're using VS Code with the Quarkdown extension,
you can launch the live preview using the corresponding 🔍 button
or pressing `Ctrl/⌘+Shift+V`



## Markup

Quarkdown is built upon Markdown, with several GFM extensions.

To try out basic markup within Quarkdown, you can append the following to the existing content of `my-document.qd`,
and feel free to play around with it:

```markdown
### A Quarkdown tour

No need to reinvent the wheel: you can make text **bold** or *italic*,
~~strike through~~, add `inline code`,
create [links](https://quarkdown.com), and much more.

- An unordered list
- With multiple items

1. An ordered list
2. With multiple items

![Logo](image/logo.png)
```

!(650)[Markup](Quickstart/markup.png)

You may refer to resources such as [markdownguide ↗](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) to know more about Markdown.

### Image size

> References: [Image size](Image-size.qd), [Size](Sizes.qd)

You might have noticed the image in the previous example was way too large.

Quarkdown overcomes a well-known Markdown limitation by allowing image size specification:

```markdown
!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png)
```

Great! The image is now perfectly sized.

!(650)[Image size](Quickstart/image-size.png)

This sets the image width to 50% of the available width, while keeping the aspect ratio.
Supported units include `px`, `pt`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`, and `%`.
If the unit is omitted, `px` is assumed.

If you wish to specify both width and height:

```markdown
!(6cm 2cm)[Logo](image/logo.png)
```

If you wish to specify only the height:

```markdown
!(_ 2cm)[Logo](image/logo.png)
```

### Figures

> Reference: [Figures](Figure.qd)

When an image is isolated from other content, like in the previous example, it becomes a figure, which is automatically centered and can have a caption.

Let's go to the previous image:

```markdown
!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png)
```

and enhance it with a caption:

```markdown
!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png "The Quarkdown logo".qd)
```

!(650)[Figure](Quickstart/figure.png)

### Equations and formulae

> Reference: [TeX formulae](TeX-formulae.qd)

TeX equations can be included by means of the `$ expression $` syntax (beware of whitespaces).

Let's try adding equations to the bottom of our document:

```markdown
#### Equations

$ E = mc^2 $ is Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula.

$ f(x, y) = \frac{x}{y} $
```

You might notice that, despite having the same syntax, the second appears centered and on its own line. Just like figures, isolated equations automatically become block equations.

!(650)[Equations](Quickstart/equations.png)



## Function call syntax

> Reference: [Syntax of a function call](Syntax-of-a-function-call.qd)

Before going deeper into other features, let's briefly explore Quarkdown's function call syntax.

Function calls start with a dot and use curly braces for arguments, which may be positional or named:

```
.pow {5} to:{2} is a mathematical operation.
```

Function calls can be *inline* or *block*, depending on whether they are isolated or not from other content.

Block function calls also allow an indented *block argument*,
which always refers to the last parameter of the function, positionally speaking:

```
.align {center}
    This multi-line paragraph is the block argument,
    and it's now centered in the document.
```

Multiple function calls can also be chained together,
so that the output of one refers to the first parameter of the next:

```markdown
.sqrt {10}::round::multiply {2} <!-- 6 -->
```

> [!TIP]
> A full list of available functions can be found in the [docs](https://quarkdown.com/docs/quarkdown-stdlib/).

### Variables

> Reference: [Variables](Variables.qd)

A variable is defined using the `.var` function,
and can be accessed like any function.

```
.var {name} {John}

My name is .name
```

A variable can be overwritten by supplying an argument:

```
.name {Jane}
```



## Custom elements

> Reference: [Declaring functions](Declaring-functions.qd), [Boxes](Box.qd)

Custom functions can be defined via `.function`.
Functions are reusable, versatile components that can encapsulate logic and content.
In this guide, we'll create a function that generates an *Example* box,
commonly used in educational documents.

Let's start by defining a function without parameters:

```markdown
.docauthors
    - ...

.function {example}
    .box {Example} type:{tip}
        This is my example!

## Quickstart
...
```

And let's call it:

```markdown
## Quickstart

.example

...
```

Great! Calling `.example` now produces a nicely formatted box.

Let's enhance our function by adding a parameter for the content of the box.
The syntax for parameters is `param1 param2 param3:`.

```markdown
.function {example}
    content:
    .box {Example} type:{tip}
        .content
```

And let's update the call accordingly.

```markdown
.example
    This is my example!
```

!(650)[Custom element](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/039bdd8b-a47f-4ebb-996d-ba0de4632a35)



Congratulations! You've created your first reusable element that relies on [box](Box.qd).
Many more layout tools are available, such as [containers](Container.qd) and [stacks](Stacks.qd).

If you're looking for advanced styling of custom elements, you may even use
CSS rules: see [CSS](CSS.qd) for more information.

> For the sake of simplicity for this guide, let's remove the function call:
>
> ```diff
> - .example
> -    This is my example!
> ```



## Numbering

> Reference: [Numbering](Numbering.qd)

Many documents, especially academic ones, require some elements to be numbered, such as sections, figures, tables, equations and code. In Quarkdown, this can be achieved using the `.numbering` function.

> [!NOTE]
> `paged` documents come with a default numbering.

Head to the top of our document's source code, right before the beginning of content,
and set up a simple numbering scheme:

```markdown
.docauthors
    - ...

.numbering
    - headings: 1.1.1
    - figures: 1.1

.function {example}
    ...

## Quickstart
...
```

> This YAML-like syntax represents a [dictionary](Dictionary.qd) data type.

!(650)[Numbering](Quickstart/numbering.png)

Valid symbols are: 
- `1` (decimal)
- `A` (uppercase letters)
- `a` (lowercase letters)
- `I` (uppercase Roman numerals)
- `i` (lowercase Roman numerals)

Any other character will be treated as literal text.



## Table of contents

> Reference: [Table of contents](Table-of-contents.qd)

It's common for longer documents to have a table of contents at the beginning, listing all sections and subsections.

In Quarkdown, it's as easy as calling the `.tableofcontents` function where you want the table of contents to appear, for example before the first section:

```markdown
.numbering
    - ...

.tableofcontents

## Quickstart
...
```



## Footnotes

> Reference: [Footnotes](Footnotes.qd)

Footnotes are a great way to add additional information without cluttering the main text.
For our quickstart, let's go back to our introduction and add a footnote to it:

```markdown
### A Quarkdown tour

No need to reinvent the wheel: you can make text **bold** or *italic*,
~~strike through~~, add `inline code`,
create [links](https://quarkdown.com), and much more[^1].

[^1]: All Markdown features are supported in Quarkdown
```

This is the GFM footnote syntax, which Quarkdown fully supports,
along with compact footnotes, which allow defining a footnote inline, right where it's referenced:

```markdown
and much more[^: All Markdown features are supported in Quarkdown].
```

In `plain` documents, footnotes are more like side notes, and appear in the margin, next to the reference.
In `paged` and `slides` documents, footnotes appear at the bottom of the page or slide.



## Cross-references

> Reference: [Cross-references](Cross-references.qd)

Cross-references allow referring to other elements in the document which can be numbered.

The first step is to add an ID to the target element.
After that, the element can be referenced using the `.ref {id}` function.

Let's go back to our figure:

```markdown
!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png "The Quarkdown logo".qd)
```

add the `logo` ID to it, and reference it in the text:

```markdown
!(50%)[Logo](image/logo.png "The Quarkdown logo".qd) {#logo}

The Quarkdown logo is shown in .ref {logo}.
```

!(650)[Cross-reference](Quickstart/cross-reference.png)

See [Cross-references](Cross-references.qd) to learn how to add IDs to other elements, such as sections, tables, equations and code blocks.



## Page margins and counter

> References: [Page format](Page-format.qd), [Page margin content](Page-margin-content.qd), [Page counter](Page-counter.qd)

In `paged` and `slides` documents, you'll likely need a page counter
to improve navigation and provide context to readers.

First off, let's switch to the `paged` document type by changing `.doctype`'s value at the top of our document:

```diff
- .doctype {plain}
+ .doctype {paged}
```

> The default page format is A4.
> Along with other properties, it can be changed using the `.pageformat` function:
>
> ```markdown
> .pageformat {letter} margin:{2cm}
> ```

Let's now add a page counter to the bottom-center area of each page:

```markdown
.docauthors
    - ...

.pagemargin {bottomcenter}
    .currentpage / .totalpages

.numbering
    - ...
```

This way, each page will show its number, and the total number of pages.

In general, `.pagemargin` can be used to add any kind of content to each page.
See [Page margin content](Page-margin-content.qd) to see the available margin positions.

### Persistent headings

> Reference: [Persistent headings](Persistent-headings.qd)

Page margins can also be used to display the current section, such as chapter title, on each page. The following example displays the current level-1 heading in the bottom left margin:

```markdown
.pagemargin {bottomcenter}
    ...

.pagemargin {bottomleft}
    .lastheading depth:{1}

.numbering
    - ...
```



## Multi-file projects

> Reference: [Inclusion vs. subdocuments](Inclusion-vs-subdocuments.qd)

There are two main ways to split a large document into multiple source files: 
inclusion and subdocuments.

### Including files

> Reference: [Including other Quarkdown files](Including-other-Quarkdown-files.qd)

The `.include` function allows including the content of another Quarkdown file
into the current one.

This approach is common in LaTeX and other markup languages,
in order to split a large document into smaller, more manageable files,
such as one per chapter or section.

For our quickstart, we could decide to split setup and content into two separate files:

> my-document.qd

```diff
- .docname {Quickstart}
- .doctype {paged}
- .doclang {English}
- .theme {paperwhite} layout:{latex}
-
- .docauthors
-     - ...
-
- .pagemargin {bottomright} 
-     .currentpage / .totalpages
-
- .pagemargin {bottomleft}
-     .lastheading depth:{1}
-
- .numbering 
-     - headings: 1.1.1
-     - figures: 1.1

+ .include {setup.qd}
+ .include {content.qd}

- .tableofcontents
-
- # Quickstart
-
- ...
```

> setup.qd

```markdown
.docname {MyDocument}
.doctype {paged}
.doclang {English}
.theme {paperwhite} layout:{latex}

.docauthors
    - Quarkdown

.pagemargin {bottomright} 
    .currentpage / .totalpages

.numbering 
    - headings: 1.1.1
    - figures: 1.1
```

> content.qd

```markdown
.tableofcontents

## Quickstart

...
```

Here we used `.include` twice. For a larger number of files,
you might consider using `.includeall` instead:

```markdown
.includeall
    - setup.qd
    - content.qd
```

### Referencing files

> Reference: [Subdocuments](Subdocuments.qd)

The second approach involves subdocuments,
particularly common in the area of knowledge bases and wikis.

Subdocuments are independent units of content which share
the same setup and configuration,
and can be referenced from other documents through links.

> my-document.qd

```markdown
- [Introduction](introduction.qd)
- [Chapter 1](chapter1.qd)
- [Chapter 2](chapter2.qd)
- [Conclusion](conclusion.qd)
```

The knowledge graph formed by subdocuments can also be
visualized:

```markdown
.subdocumentgraph
```
