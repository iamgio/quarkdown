Quarkdown allows a blockquote to have a citation source.

In general, if the quote ends with a single-item unordered list, that list item is set as the citation source. You can specify the source using any of the supported unordered list bullets: `-`, `*`, `+`, although using `-` is recommended.

```markdown
> To be, or not to be, that is the question.
> - William Shakespeare
```

The layout and aesthetics are handled by the current theme.

The source may contain inline content, including function calls:

```markdown
> Failure's not an option. It's just a step.
> - Dwayne **The Rock** Johnson
```

Any kind of blockquote may have a source:

```markdown
>> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
>> - Wayne Gretzky
> - Michael Scott
```

[Typed quotes](Quote-types.qd) may also have sources:

```markdown
> Tip: Try out **Quarkdown**!
> - [iamgio](https://github.com/iamgio)
```
