Footnotes allow readers to reference additional information without cluttering the main content.

## Compact footnotes

Quarkdown introduces a compact `[^label: definition]` syntax that allows you to define footnotes directly at their reference point:

```markdown
This is a footnote reference[^first: This is the definition.],
and another one[^second: This is another definition.].
```

!(550)[Footnote](Footnotes/basic.png)

When an inlined footnote does not need to be referenced elsewhere, you can omit the label to create an *anonymous* footnote:

```markdown
This is a footnote reference[^: This is the definition.],
and another one[^: This is another definition.].
```

Named footnotes can be referenced multiple times:

```markdown
This is a footnote reference[^first: This is the definition],
and another one[^first].
```

Definitions can include inline formatting:

```markdown
This is a footnote reference[^first: This is the **definition**.]
```

## Standard footnotes

Quarkdown also supports the standard footnote syntax provided by many Markdown flavors.

This approach is more verbose but allows for a clean separation between the footnote reference and its definition, reducing clutter in the main text.

```markdown
This is a footnote reference[^1].

[^1]: This is the definition.
```

Inline formatting is also supported in the definition:

```markdown
[^1]: This is the **definition**.
```

Long definitions can span multiple lines. Indentation is not significant:

```markdown
[^1]: This is
      the definition.
```

When you have multiple footnotes, separate the definitions with at least one blank line:

```markdown
This is a footnote reference[^first], and another one[^second].

[^first]: This is the definition.

[^second]: This is another definition.
```

Multiple references to the same footnote label are allowed, and they all point to the same definition:

```markdown
This is a footnote reference[^first], and another one[^first].

[^first]: This is the definition.
```

The footnote label can be any string, and the definition can appear anywhere in the document:

```markdown
[^first]: This is the definition.

This is a footnote reference[^first], and another one[^second].

[^second]: This is another definition.
```

## Numbering

Footnotes are numbered by default with decimal numbers, starting from 1. To apply a different numbering style, such as Roman numerals, use the `.numbering` function:

```yaml
.numbering
  - footnotes: i
```

See [*Numbering*](Numbering.qd) for more information.

Footnotes are numbered incrementally across the document. Page-level numbering is not supported yet.

## Display

Footnotes render differently depending on the document type. See [*Document types*](Document-types.qd) for more information.
