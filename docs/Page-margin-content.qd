.docname {Page margin content}
.include {_Setup.qd}

The **`.pagemargin`** function displays content on each page, in a fixed position along its [margins](Page-format.qd#content-area).

- In `paged` documents, a special area of each page is reserved for margins:

- In `plain` and `slides` documents, content set on margins could potentially overlap page content.

- In `plain` documents, where the concept of *page* does not exist, page margins are displayed once per document.

The function accepts an optional `position` and a body argument `content`:

| Parameter | Description | Accepts |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `position` | Page area to target. | `topleftcorner`, `topleft`, `topcenter`, `topright`, `toprightcorner`, `righttop`, `rightmiddle`, `rightbottom`, `bottomrightcorner`, `bottomright`, `bottomcenter`, `bottomleft`, `bottomleftcorner`, `leftbottom`, `leftmiddle`, `lefttop`, *`topoutsidecorner`, `topoutside`, `topinsidecorner`, `topinside`, `bottomoutsidecorner`, `bottomoutside`, `bottominsidecorner`, `bottominside`* |
| `content` | Element to display. | [Block content](Markdown-content.qd#block-content) |

```markdown
.pagemargin {topright}
    **This** is a margin content.
```

## Scoped margins

When used in `paged` and `slides` documents, page margin content takes effect only from the page where it's declared onward. This allows for different page margin settings in different parts of the document.

```markdown
.pagemargin {topcenter}
    On all pages

## First page

## Second page

.pagemargin {topleft}
    From second page

## Third page
```

Overwriting the page margin again will change it from that point onward:

```markdown
...

## Third page

.pagemargin {topcenter}
    From third page
```

## Mirror positions

Along with fixed positions, such as `topright` or `bottomleft`,
there is also support for *mirror positions*, which adapt based on whether the page is left (even number) or right (odd number).

Mirror positions are marked in italics in the table above,
and refer to `outside` and `inside` areas:

```markdown
.pagemargin {topoutside}
    **This** is a margin content.
```

Although they are primarily designed for `paged` documents,
mirror positions are also supported in `slides` ones.



## Footer

Most layout themes associate the `bottomcenter` margin to the document footer, and style it differently - for instance, different blocks may be displayed in a row. Footers are particularly used in `slides` documents.

The **`.footer`** function is a shorthand for `.pagemargin {bottomcenter}`.

```
.theme {beaver} layout:{beamer}

.footer
    .docauthor

    **.docname**

## Page counter

A page margin can host a page counter: see [Page counter](Page-counter.qd).
