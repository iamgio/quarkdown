.docname {Table of contents}
.include {docs}

A table of contents provides a quick overview of your document by displaying links to headings in a visual hierarchy. Readers can click on any entry to jump directly to that section. You can see a table of contents right now in the right sidebar, or at the end of the page if you're on a mobile device.

You can display a table of contents through the **`.tableofcontents`** .docslink {quarkdown-stdlib/com.quarkdown.stdlib.module.Document/tableofcontents.html} function.

## Basic usage

The function accepts the following optional parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Accepts | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `title` | Title that precedes the table of contents. If unset, it is automatically localized. | Inline content | Automatically localized if [`.doclang`](document-metadata.qd)'s locale is supported (e.g., `Table of Contents` for English) |
| `maxdepth` | Maximum heading level to display. For example, `maxdepth:{2}` collects `#` and `##` headings, but not `###` or deeper. | Integer | `3` |
| `focus` | Highlights the item matching this text. Inline formatting (bold, italics) is ignored when comparing. | [Inline content](markdown-content.qd#inline-content) | (none) |

.exampleoutput {!(550)[Table of contents](table-of-contents/basic.png)}
    .tableofcontents maxdepth:{2}

## Behavior by document type

The table of contents adapts to different document types:

- In **`paged`** and **`slides`** documents, each entry also displays the corresponding page number.
- In **`slides`** documents, the table of contents has a constrained height and becomes vertically scrollable when content overflows.

## Theming

[Layout themes](themes.qd) greatly influence the appearance of the table of contents.

.example
    !(550)[Table of contents with minimal theme](table-of-contents/minimal-theme.png "'minimal' theme")

## Ignoring specific headings

Sometimes you want certain headings to appear in your document but not in the table of contents. [Decorative headings](numbering.qd#decorative-headings) serve this purpose: they are not numbered and do not appear in the table of contents by default.

To mark a heading as decorative, append `!` to the last `#` sign:

```markdown
##! A decorative heading
```

If you want decorative headings to appear in the table of contents anyway, enable the `includeunnumbered` parameter:

```markdown
.tableofcontents includeunnumbered:{yes}
```

## Custom numbering

You can customize how headings are numbered in the table of contents via the `.numbering` function. See [Numbering](numbering.qd) for more information.

## Focusing entries

The `focus` parameter highlights a specific entry in the table of contents, drawing attention to the current section.

.exampleoutput {!(550)[Table of contents with focus](table-of-contents/focused.png)} prelude:{Adding `focus:{A.B}` to the previous example highlights that entry:}
    .tableofcontents maxdepth:{2} focus:{A.B}

This feature is particularly useful in presentations, where you might want to show a mini table of contents at the beginning of each chapter to orient your audience.

### Using markers for chapter navigation

For slide presentations, you can combine focusing with **markers** to create elegant chapter navigation. The `.marker` function creates an invisible level-0 heading, which is not normally possible with the standard `#`-based syntax.

Here is a practical pattern for chapter slides:

```markdown
.function {chapter}
    name:
    .tableofcontents maxdepth:{0} focus:{.name}
    .marker {.name}
```

You can then invoke it with `.chapter {My chapter}` at the start of each section. Setting `maxdepth:{0}` ensures only markers appear in the table of contents, creating a clean chapter-level overview rather than showing all headings.
