Speaker notes are helpful tools for remembering talking points, reminders, or extra details while presenting.

Calling the **`.speakernote`** function will add a speaker note to the current slide. It accepts a block of any kind of content, and multiple speaker notes can be added to the same slide.

```markdown
.speakernote
  This is a **speaker note** for the current slide.
```

By default, speaker notes are displayed only when the document is viewed in the **speaker view**, which can be enabled by pressing the **`S`** key while viewing the HTML presentation.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Reveal.js' speaker view requires an active [web server](CLI-‐-Webserver.qd).

### Outside speaker view

Additionally, notes may be displayed outside of the speaker view, and also in exported PDF, by enabling `.slides speakernotes:{yes}` (see [Slides configuration](Slides-configuration.qd)).
