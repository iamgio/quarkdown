.docname {Quote types}
.include {_Setup.qd}

If a blockquote begins with `Tip:`, `Note:`, `Warning:`, or `Important:`, Quarkdown assigns that type to the quote. The prefix is stripped off and the element is styled accordingly.

.examplemirror
    > Note: Some useful information to keep in mind.

For compatibility purposes, the GitHub-style syntax `[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!WARNING]`, and `[!IMPORTANT]` is also supported.

.examplemirror
    > [!NOTE]
    > Some useful information to keep in mind.

If the document's locale is set via [`.doclang`](Document-metadata.qd) and the locale is supported, a localized prefix is displayed and styled according to the current layout theme.

!(550)[Minimal theme](Quote-types/minimal-theme.png "Localized prefix in the 'minimal' layout theme")

!(650)[Latex theme](Quote-types/latex-theme.png "Localized prefix in the 'latex' layout theme")

> Tip: Quotes and [boxes](Box.qd) are different ways to achieve typed alerts.
